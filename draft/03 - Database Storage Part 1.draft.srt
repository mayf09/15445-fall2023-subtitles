00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,935
0,275 275,410 410,650 650,1150 2130,2405
I heard a rumor I

2
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,320
0,225 225,420 420,570 570,840 840,1385
heard to date Larry ellison's

3
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,040
0,400
girlfriend.|

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,500
0,245 245,425 425,620 620,755 755,860
What happened? He stole it

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,780
0,105 105,350
from you.|

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,635
0,320 320,395 395,515 515,635 635,755
We'll come back to that

7
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,920
0,275 2095,2505 2505,2850 2850,2970 2970,3285
later. Larry ellison, the founder

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,630
0,480 480,690 690,840 840,1130 1420,1710
Oracle. He is the fifth

9
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,820
0,390 390,675 675,840 840,930 930,1190
richest person in the world.

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,530
0,260 260,575 575,680 680,1055 1055,1300
He owns a Hawaiian island

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,630
0,365 365,620 620,755 755,875 875,1510
all pay for by databases.

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,185
0,335 335,440 440,560 560,770 770,1115
That's why this class exists,

13
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:11,320
0,395 3385,3885 3885,4205 4345,4740 4740,5135
right? Administrative stuff. So the

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,955
0,365 365,730 1500,1790 1790,2075 2075,2435
homework one, we do this

15
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,740
0,270 270,555 555,825 825,1115 1435,1785
coming sunday. The tenth. Project

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,625
0,270 270,510 510,675 675,780 780,885
zero is also due the

17
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,960
0,245 475,795 795,975 975,1125 1125,1335
tenth. Who here has not

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,440
0,240 240,525 525,890
started project zero?|

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,940
0,400 420,680 680,940
One, why not?|

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,200
0,380
Two.|

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,910
0,215 215,275 275,380 380,620 620,880
Do you know cos laws?|

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,655
0,290 290,380 380,640 900,1115 1115,1175
That a no do you

23
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,120
0,245 265,665
know less?|

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,965
0,400 450,770 770,935 935,1055 1055,1295
Now, okay, you should really

25
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,845
0,270 270,575 1855,2255 2515,2775 2775,2880
start because if if you

26
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,840
0,195 195,450 450,600 600,720 720,995
know zero c plus plus

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,945
0,260 260,380 380,470 470,590 590,785
it will be a struggle.

28
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,310
0,180 180,455 535,825 825,1055 1105,1365
And again we're not trying

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,030
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,480 480,720
to do this to torture

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,020
0,230 280,600 600,720 720,885 885,990
you. It's really meant to

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,580
0,90 90,350 1030,1305 1305,1440 1440,1560
be like this is what

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,105
0,90 90,195 195,300 300,390 390,525
the rest of the course

33
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:41,645
0,135 135,225 225,285 285,390 390,540
is going to be like

34
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:42,370
0,135 135,270 270,375 375,465 465,725
in terms of the projects.

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,775
0,290 290,455 455,710 710,845 845,995
If you don't know how

36
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,720
0,120 120,375 375,600 600,735 735,945
to write c plus plus

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,470
0,165 165,315 315,375 375,480 480,750
and don't how to debug

38
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,655
0,290 700,990 990,1035 1035,1080 1080,1185
it, you're going to have

39
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,250
0,275 1255,1575 1575,1830 1830,2165 2215,2595
problems. Print f or standard

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,300
0,240 240,435 435,660 660,870 870,1050
c out is not a

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,720
0,315 315,650 3070,3300 3300,3360 3360,3420
debug method. You want to

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,815
0,75 75,165 165,615 615,870 870,1095
use a debugger and then

43
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:55,990
0,315 315,570 570,720 720,870 870,1175
project one will be released.

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,635
0,260 260,350 350,440 440,500 500,605
We supposed to go out

45
00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:58,730
0,275 445,735 735,870 870,945 945,1095
today, probably will come out

46
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,010
0,320 1480,1755 1755,2040 2040,2145 2145,2280
friday and that'll be on

47
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,865
0,105 105,345 345,510 510,675 675,855
the buffer pool which will

48
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,050
0,195 195,465 465,845 865,1110 1110,1185
start teaching in in a

49
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,240
0,90 90,210 210,470 1600,1935 1935,2190
week and half any questions

50
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,230
0,195 195,405 405,615 615,765 765,990
about homework one or project

51
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,360
0,350
zero.|

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,370
0,400 1200,1600 1890,2180 2180,2330 2330,2510
OK, all jump the material.

53
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,570
0,255 255,540 540,825 825,1035 1035,1200
So last class we spent

54
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,530
0,210 210,510 510,890 1240,1790 2560,2960
time talking about sql and

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,010
0,400 480,725 725,905 905,1145 1145,1280
all the modern things you

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,840
0,75 75,165 165,255 255,390 390,830
can do with the cte

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,560
0,470 470,860 860,1190 1190,1505 1505,1700
lateral joins, nested queries, window

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,885
0,285 285,525 525,690 690,980 2020,2325
functions and so forth. Prior

59
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:23,635
0,150 150,270 270,405 405,585 585,750
to that we talked about

60
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,470
0,285 285,635 685,990 990,1275 1275,1835
theational model and relational algebra.

61
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,780
0,400 840,1085 1085,1250 1250,1550 1550,1930
And so at this point

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,625
0,640 1530,1805 1805,2345 2345,2540 2540,2705
that's the logical view of

63
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,615
0,165 165,315 315,555 555,840 840,990
what the database system is

64
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:32,305
0,90 90,195 195,345 345,540 540,690
going to look like that

65
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:33,025
0,120 120,165 165,330 330,600 600,720
we're going to. We're sort

66
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,480
0,240 240,840 840,1110 1110,1320 1320,1455
of mentally construct throughout the

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,040
0,90 90,195 195,300 300,620 1210,1560
rest of the semester. So

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,700
0,255 255,360 360,480 480,540 540,660
we're not going to go

69
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,660
0,225 225,405 405,585 585,795 795,960
back to these, discuss these

70
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,665
0,210 210,390 390,585 585,765 765,1005
things. But we'll see how

71
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,370
0,180 180,285 285,405 405,540 540,705
we need to know what

72
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,540
0,240 240,390 390,615 615,930 930,1170
sql looks like relational model

73
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,710
0,320 430,675 675,795 795,960 960,1170
is in order to build

74
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,595
0,165 165,360 360,615 615,765 765,885
the various parts of the

75
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,230
0,275 745,1020 1020,1125 1125,1365 1365,1635
system we'll be discussing going

76
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,400
0,320 610,840 840,915 915,1035 1035,1170
forward. So as I said

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,970
0,120 120,210 210,315 315,465 465,570
at the end end of

78
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,200
0,135 135,420 420,750 750,1020 1020,1230
last class, this point forward

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,270
0,135 135,240 240,495 495,750 750,1070
in the semester going forward

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,305
0,305 305,455 455,590 590,880 990,1265
up to around Thanksgiving is

81
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:51,100
0,275 295,570 570,675 675,720 720,795
going is going to be

82
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,540
0,105 105,225 225,465 465,830 1210,1440
how to build a sort

83
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,330
0,105 105,345 345,710 760,1050 1050,1790
of a classic or canonical

84
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,850
0,400 840,1325 1325,1655 1655,1955 1955,2320
database relational database management system.|

85
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,355
0,335 335,665 665,1060 1110,1355 1355,1625
So the eh, the outline

86
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:02,050
0,275 295,600 600,855 855,1205 1345,1695
for going forward. We, we've

87
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,130
0,165 165,375 375,510 510,690 690,1080
already discussed what professional databases

88
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,550
0,260 1540,1830 1830,2120 2920,3210 3210,3420
are, but the, the first

89
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,650
0,225 225,480 480,675 675,810 810,1100
four topics here is George

90
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,820
0,350 350,755 755,950 950,1270 1710,2030
execution, concurrent, go recovery. These

91
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,340
0,210 210,500 880,1280 1780,2180 2290,2520
are the the aspects you

92
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,135
0,75 75,180 180,300 300,555 555,795
would need to have to

93
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,420
0,180 180,515
build a.|

94
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,750
0,285 285,540 540,860 1420,1820 1930,2330
A full featured, safe, reliable

95
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,700
0,380 380,740 740,1120
database management system.|

96
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,410
0,260 940,1320 1320,1470 1470,1620 1620,1710
And we'll assume it's going

97
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,810
0,260 340,600 600,750 750,960 960,1400
running on a single notede

98
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,110
0,245 245,380 380,545 545,665 665,800
because it makes our life

99
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,325
0,290 310,630 630,765 765,1050 1050,1215
easier. Don't go distribute until

100
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:26,750
0,120 120,255 255,545 1015,1275 1275,1425
you have to. And then

101
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,550
0,290 340,705 705,1070 1450,1695 1695,1800
once we understand what a

102
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,555
0,180 180,435 435,600 600,810 810,1005
single node database system looks

103
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,100
0,305 505,900 900,1125 1125,1320 1320,1545
like, we'll, we'll then discuss

104
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,150
0,150 150,330 330,570 570,825 825,1050
how to expand this and

105
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,965
0,290 430,720 720,1310 1450,1695 1695,1815
do distributed databases. And at

106
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:34,595
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,375 375,630
the end of the semester,

107
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:35,270
0,240 240,345 345,420 420,480 480,675
we'll talk a little bit

108
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,950
0,225 225,500 610,945 945,1280 1420,1680
also to about how, what

109
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,380
0,180 180,450 450,735 735,975 975,1430
other additional features and optimizations

110
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,055
0,245 245,410 410,730 1080,1340 1340,1475
we can apply, which then

111
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,110
0,135 135,225 225,330 330,735 735,1055
will be a segue into

112
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,395
0,290 290,515 515,800 800,995 995,1085
the advanced class if you

113
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:43,205
0,90 90,195 195,330 330,570 570,810
want to take that in

114
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,050
0,180 180,485 1375,1620 1620,1710 1710,1845
the spring. So the way

115
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,890
0,135 135,240 240,420 420,600 600,840
to think about a database

116
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,675
0,315 315,650 730,1130 1420,1665 1665,1785
management system and the way

117
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:48,550
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,585 585,875
the course is laid out

118
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,290
0,400 540,800 800,950 950,1115 1115,1570
is a bunch of layers.

119
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,160
0,380 380,620 620,815 815,1190 1190,1280
And the different layers are

120
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,330
0,60 60,180 180,360 360,555 555,1170
going to provide different functionality

121
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,515
0,105 105,350 580,825 825,930 930,1185
to capabilities for the database

122
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,450
0,395 985,1385 1525,1815 1815,1875 1875,1935
system. And they're going to

123
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,280
0,405 405,585 585,1160 1210,1575 1575,1830
expose an API to whatever

124
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,285
0,150 150,300 300,525 525,795 795,1005
the layer is is above

125
00:03:59,285 --> 00:03:59,900
0,275
it.|

126
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,710
0,260 260,485 485,850 1080,1370 1370,1580
And it the, the topics

127
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,210
0,300 300,555 555,890 970,1305 1305,1500
we discuss again basically how

128
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,485
0,180 180,375 375,540 540,980 1030,1275
to construct those layers, put

129
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,520
0,90 90,255 255,540 540,810 810,1035
it all together and have

130
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,900
0,300 300,570 570,810 810,1110 1110,1380
a full featured database management

131
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,520
0,320 850,1200 1200,1380 1380,1485 1485,1620
system. So the way to

132
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,165
0,135 135,255 255,315 315,405 405,645
think about it is that

133
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,280
0,210 210,345 345,965 1405,1950 1950,2115
the most simplistic viewpoint would

134
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,190
0,260 670,1035 1035,1335 1335,1590 1590,1910
be the application comes along

135
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,775
0,320 320,500 500,590 590,665 665,815
and you going to issue

136
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,110
0,165 165,390 390,665 835,1110 1110,1335
a sql query and that's

137
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,770
0,75 75,195 195,375 375,540 540,660
going to first show up

138
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,690
0,105 105,255 255,800 1330,1635 1635,1920
and get parsed. The string

139
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,680
0,300 300,540 540,720 720,825 825,990
of text of the sql

140
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,090
0,105 105,240 240,680 1030,1290 1290,1410
query gets parsed, run through

141
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,685
0,105 105,345 345,950 1990,2340 2340,2595
the query optimizer below that.

142
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:24,720
0,180 180,345 345,555 555,900 900,1035
Then we'll start executing whatever

143
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,905
0,90 90,255 255,435 435,710 910,1185
the query plan is. There'll

144
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,135
0,180 180,435 435,660 660,945 945,1230
be access methods that to

145
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,910
0,210 210,420 420,735 735,1115 1375,1775
actually talk to the the

146
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,480
0,400 480,815 815,1175 1175,1295 1295,1550
tables or indexes or whatever

147
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,025
0,255 255,315 315,480 480,800 1270,1545
we're trying to access. That'll

148
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:32,780
0,60 60,150 150,375 375,480 480,755
be a buffer po manager

149
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,245
0,260 260,455 455,650 650,910 1080,1415
to manage the memory for

150
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,775
0,195 195,390 390,725 1135,1410 1410,1530
our database system. And then

151
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,480
0,105 105,225 225,405 405,585 585,705
at the lowest level will

152
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,115
0,90 90,195 195,435 435,680 1270,1635
be a disk manager that'll

153
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:39,780
0,210 210,570 570,935 1045,1380 1380,1665
be responsible for reading writing

154
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
0,350 640,885 885,1370
data to disk.|

155
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,865
0,275 275,550 960,1430 1430,1595 1595,1775
And so today's class, we're

156
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,350
0,30 30,90 90,335 1105,1380 1380,1485
going to start getting the

157
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,285
0,290 670,900 900,1005 1005,1280 1660,1935
semester at the bottom and

158
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:48,400
0,195 195,435 435,645 645,825 825,1115
then work our way up.|

159
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,630
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,465 465,630
When we get to something

160
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,640
0,180 180,315 315,810 810,1160 1600,2010
like a currentrome recovery, that's

161
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,585
0,75 75,195 195,525 525,720 720,945
going to permeate throughout the

162
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,875
0,270 270,635 895,1125 1125,1200 1200,1290
entire system. So we have

163
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,715
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,480 480,840
to come back and revisit

164
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,560
0,150 150,345 345,635 1435,1695 1695,1845
all these things. When we're

165
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,700
0,165 165,500 640,900 900,1020 1020,1140
running transactions, we need to

166
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,965
0,260 730,1065 1065,1185 1185,1730 2020,2265
know what's on disk. We

167
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,230
0,135 135,330 330,555 555,810 810,1265
didn't know what we're accessing,

168
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,355
0,275 275,530 530,830 830,1090 1620,1955
how we're accessing it, what,

169
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,000
0,225 225,465 465,705 705,1115
what queries we're executing.|

170
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,640
0,255 255,525 525,840 840,1220 1240,1640
Right. So the storage execution

171
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,775
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,590 590,725
will get us through the

172
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,380
0,225 225,575 1105,1365 1365,1470 1470,1605
entire stack and then we'll

173
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,130
0,105 105,270 270,465 465,645 645,750
come back and touch it

174
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,095
0,120 120,330 330,650 1540,1800 1800,1965
all over again. That sounds

175
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,160
0,255 255,585 585,855 855,945 945,1065
weird, but we'll look at

176
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,460
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,800 4900,5300
it all over again, distributed

177
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,625
0,305 305,470 470,605 605,755 755,935
we to know about all

178
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,080
0,180 180,345 345,635 2815,3135 3135,3455
these things in a reliable,

179
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,960
0,380 380,665 665,970
safe, distributed database.|

180
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,920
0,320
Okay.|

181
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,620
0,400
Right.|

182
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,765
0,400 840,1130 1130,1420 1530,1865 1865,2075
So for the system, we're

183
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,385
0,30 30,135 135,425 805,1205 1285,1620
going to discuss the methods

184
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,060
0,180 180,210 210,315 315,510 510,675
we going to discuss this

185
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,670
0,320 850,1155 1155,1215 1215,1335 1335,1610
semester. We're going to assume

186
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,375
0,365 365,590 590,850 1020,1265 1265,1355
that the architecture of what

187
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,545
0,135 135,225 225,345 345,605 895,1170
we're trying to build again

188
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,655
0,180 180,675 675,780 780,810 810,1110
think conceptually we're going toruct

189
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:39,750
0,105 105,195 195,455 655,915 915,1095
in our minds, A D

190
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,980
0,210 210,500 610,885 885,1065 1065,1230
management system and bus hub

191
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,320
0,135 135,330 330,650 760,1050 1050,1340
is one implementation of this.|

192
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,690
0,320 320,365 365,440 440,575 575,740
We're going to say we're

193
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,515
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,600 600,825
building what is called a

194
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,955
0,345 345,540 540,840 840,1200 1200,1440
disk based database system or

195
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,160
0,120 120,375 375,780 780,1115
a disk oriented architecture.|

196
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,300
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,725 725,890
And this is where the

197
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,740
0,225 225,525 525,860 910,1245 1245,1440
database minimum system itself is

198
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,900
0,105 105,285 285,615 615,885 885,1160
going to assume that the

199
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,710
0,400 480,845 845,1175 1175,1400 1400,1520
primary storage location of the

200
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,315
0,260 880,1200 1200,1365 1365,1455 1455,1605
database is going to be

201
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,180
0,270 270,615 615,930 930,1380 1380,1865
on some non volatile disk,

202
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,930
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,1060 1080,1370
could be an ssd, a

203
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,325
0,240 240,375 375,555 555,860 1150,1395
spinning just hard drive if

204
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:01,300
0,135 135,285 285,495 495,765 765,975
you're running the cloud, could

205
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,610
0,75 75,255 255,590 1690,2010 2010,2310
be s three, assuming that

206
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,300
0,270 270,330 330,390 390,495 495,690
it's going to be Dis

207
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,280
0,320
based.|

208
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,915
0,305 305,575 575,800 800,965 965,1145
And all the things we're

209
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:07,635
0,30 30,105 105,345 345,585 585,720
going to build in our

210
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,765
0,275 475,875 1135,1440 1440,1745 1765,2130
database system are really designed

211
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,140
0,210 210,455
to now.|

212
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,390
0,485 485,680 680,1330 1440,1760 1760,2030
Coordinate or orchestrate the movement

213
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,965
0,240 240,530 820,1125 1125,1320 1320,1575
of data back and forth

214
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,260
0,365 415,945 945,1200 1200,1535
from disk into memory.|

215
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,570
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,790 1560,1850
This should not be news

216
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,230
0,180 180,330 330,435 435,525 525,660
for anyone. This is the

217
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,440
0,270 270,810 810,1070 1630,1920 1920,2210
classic vonoman architecture, where the

218
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,830
0,365 365,590 590,770 770,995 995,1190
data is at rest on

219
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,560
0,530 580,855 855,1215 1215,1455 1455,1730
disk. We can't operate it

220
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,335
0,275 275,410 410,515 515,590 590,725
unless we bring it into

221
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:27,460
0,305 325,570 570,675 675,810 810,1125
memory, and then the cpu

222
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,240
0,105 105,240 240,450 450,615 615,780
can do whatever it needs

223
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
0,180 180,440
to it.|

224
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,170
0,245 245,365 365,515 515,665 665,800
So this is, this is

225
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,015
0,120 120,380 1240,1560 1560,1725 1725,1845
the overall theme of what

226
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,185
0,195 195,330 330,465 465,725 925,1170
we're trying to build, and

227
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:33,875
0,105 105,285 285,495 495,615 615,690
this is obviously going to

228
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,615
0,135 135,345 345,665 985,1385 1405,1740
be super hard. And again,

229
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,000
0,210 210,510 510,765 765,1050 1050,1385
if you're an application developer,

230
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,955
0,290 290,530 530,605 605,680 680,785
you don't want to be

231
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:38,990
0,165 165,405 405,675 675,840 840,1035
doing this yourself in your

232
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,850
0,285 285,620 1360,1620 1620,1740 1740,1860
application code. You want a

233
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,915
0,255 255,540 540,735 735,930 930,1065
data system that knows how

234
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,145
0,105 105,225 225,450 450,975 975,1230
to do this reliably and

235
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,130
0,255 255,480 480,785 1075,1395 1395,1985
safely and correctly and efficiently

236
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,440
0,260 260,350 350,455 455,605 605,880
to do it for you.|

237
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,055
0,245 245,335 335,470 470,620 620,815
So the way to think

238
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,010
0,335 715,1050 1050,1335 1335,1620 1620,1955
about what storage looks like

239
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,505
0,245 245,425 425,665 665,935 935,1145
from our perspective as from

240
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:55,230
0,90 90,330 330,725 985,1385 1435,1725
a data system is in

241
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,205
0,180 180,330 330,465 465,900 900,975
terms of this hierarchy. And

242
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:56,790
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,390 390,585
you might have seen this

243
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,530
0,195 195,360 360,680 1060,1440 1440,1740
in other classes or other

244
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,990
0,300 300,1010 2020,2265 2265,2355 2355,2460
other textbooks. And the way

245
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,620
0,120 120,240 240,375 375,510 510,630
to think about this is

246
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,225
0,260 640,990 990,1215 1215,1350 1350,1605
that going from the bottom

247
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:05,280
0,240 240,375 375,665 1045,1445 1735,2055
to the top, the, the

248
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,390
0,315 315,690 690,930 930,1020 1020,1110
storage devices are going to

249
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,150
0,260 460,860 1780,2145 2145,2490 2490,2760
get faster, but smaller and

250
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,420
0,240 240,590
more expensive.|

251
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,650
0,305 305,470 470,620 620,875 875,1160
So at the bottom layer

252
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,625
0,255 255,450 450,600 600,780 780,975
here you have something like

253
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,650
0,270 270,635 1435,1710 1710,1830 1830,2025
network storage. This would be

254
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,960
0,285 285,570 570,780 780,975 975,1310
E S or s three

255
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
0,260 260,520 690,1055 1055,1265 1265,1400
I think in in the

256
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,090
0,405 405,570 570,645 645,795 795,1050
textbook there's a layer below

257
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,305
0,300 300,495 495,675 675,915 915,1215
this. They have tape drives

258
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,285
0,395 1015,1335 1335,1560 1560,1770 1770,1980
but nobody runs database systems

259
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,630
0,180 180,420 420,785 1825,2085 2085,2345
off those anymore. But like

260
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,005
0,320 320,500 500,620 620,800 800,1055
as you go up after

261
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:26,875
0,270 270,540 540,720 720,795 795,870
network storage and you have

262
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,150
0,90 90,195 195,525 525,815 955,1275
like a locally attached spinning,

263
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,380
0,135 135,315 315,620 880,1140 1140,1230
just hard drive. And then

264
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,920
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,465 465,540
you have maybe like an

265
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,150
0,105 105,255 255,530 880,1125 1125,1230
S S D and then

266
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,870
0,165 165,330 330,435 435,555 555,720
after that you have d

267
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,650
0,225 225,465 465,630 630,705 705,780
Ram, then C P U

268
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,165
0,450 450,800 940,1245 1245,1395 1395,1515
caches and now C P

269
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,100
0,515
registers.|

270
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,430
0,350 350,820 1410,1715 1715,1955 1955,2290
Right. Cp are super fast.

271
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,120
0,290 290,365 365,605 605,695 695,800
It's the fastest kind of

272
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,780
0,135 135,240 240,315 315,480 480,660
shirt you can have. But

273
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,950
0,260 310,615 615,810 810,1020 1020,1170
like we're talking, you have

274
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,210
0,290 310,525 525,645 645,750 750,1260
maybe, I don't {know32 -}

275
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,995
0,525 525,675 675,795 795,1250 1540,1785
registers on your cpu and

276
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:44,460
0,105 105,300 300,345 345,390 390,465
each one's going to be

277
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,260
0,150 150,540 540,800 1360,1650 1650,1800
about 64 bits, right? You

278
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,830
0,210 210,315 315,390 390,465 465,570
can't store a lot of

279
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,745
0,150 150,285 285,530 610,855 855,915
space in there, store a

280
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:48,530
0,75 75,240 240,435 435,555 555,785
lot of things in there.|

281
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,160
0,215 215,260 260,305 305,335 335,410
But they're going to be

282
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
0,180 180,500
super fast.|

283
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,375
0,400 510,800 800,1085 1085,1415 1415,1595
So from our perspective in

284
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,070
0,135 135,515 1015,1290 1290,1500 1500,1695
this semester, the only thing

285
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,895
0,105 105,270 270,480 480,645 645,825
we really care about is

286
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,700
0,270 270,555 555,795 795,1115
this division line here.|

287
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,125
0,75 75,210 210,405 405,870 870,1020
And that's between volatile and

288
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,680
0,195 195,570 570,845
non volatile storage.|

289
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,140
0,275 275,395 395,500 500,860 860,1120
Obviously, what does volatile mean?

290
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,900
0,245 245,335 335,635 635,910
We have volatile storage.|

291
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,720
0,60 60,290
What's that?|

292
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,215
0,260 260,455 455,665 665,935 935,1025
Yeah, it says data gone

293
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:10,785
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,465 465,570
when you when you when

294
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:11,625
0,150 150,360 360,555 555,705 705,840
you power on, you pull

295
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,675
0,135 135,345 345,555 555,750 750,1050
the plug on your dram

296
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,400
0,240 240,375 375,750 750,1295 1345,1725
or your cpu registers. Like

297
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,585
0,225 225,330 330,525 525,770 940,1185
everything gets wiped out when

298
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:16,185
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,480 480,600
you boot the systemt back

299
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:18,150
0,270 270,720 720,840 840,1115 1645,1965
up, nothing's still there. Non

300
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,530
0,360 360,600 600,870 870,1125 1125,1380
volatile basically means that you

301
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,170
0,240 240,590 610,1010 1060,1350 1350,1640
write data to the device.|

302
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,350
0,290 430,795 795,1080 1080,1260 1260,1410
And assuming that you make

303
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,150
0,290 550,950 1030,1395 1395,1650 1650,1800
the calls to tell them,

304
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,755
0,180 180,600 600,920 1210,1470 1470,1605
get flushed, or you get

305
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,345
0,135 135,285 285,815 985,1395 1395,1590
back an acknowledgement, we'll cover

306
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,055
0,150 150,425 745,1145 1165,1500 1500,1710
that later, then we assume

307
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:30,700
0,165 165,345 345,495 495,585 585,645
that data is going to

308
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,220
0,230 310,1010
be persistent.|

309
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,525
0,260 260,500 500,725 725,965 965,1235
And that no matter if

310
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,325
0,275 715,1140 1140,1275 1275,1530 1530,1800
we restart the system, pull

311
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:36,720
0,135 135,395 805,1065 1065,1230 1230,1395
the power, take the machine

312
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,470
0,165 165,300 300,360 360,495 495,750
out, put it into another

313
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,985
0,350 430,830 1000,1260 1260,1380 1380,1515
location, whatever, when we come

314
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,855
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,735 735,870
back that our data will

315
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:40,880
0,105 105,365
be there.|

316
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,310
0,245 245,380 380,635 635,995 995,1250
Of course, database systems, we

317
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,630
0,180 180,345 345,495 495,740 1090,1320
don't trust the hardware, we

318
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,290
0,105 105,195 195,360 360,540 540,660
don't trust the OS. Two,

319
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,710
0,105 105,165 165,270 270,345 345,420
we'll get that in a

320
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,880
0,260 610,840 840,960 960,1050 1050,1170
second. We don't trust any

321
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,900
0,260 310,660 660,930 930,975 975,1020
of. So we're going to

322
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,290
0,45 45,90 90,150 150,210 210,390
do a bunch of extra

323
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,400
0,270 270,435 435,585 585,810 810,1110
stuff to make sure that

324
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,855
0,225 225,330 330,495 495,800 1060,1455
if we write stuff, maybe

325
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:50,970
0,255 255,390 390,525 525,750 750,1115
we write to multiple locations

326
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,955
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,545 545,845
where we write a backup

327
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:52,915
0,135 135,240 240,485 625,855 855,960
for it, right? A bunch

328
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:53,755
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,600 600,840
of things we'll do to

329
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,210
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,665 1165,1455
make sure that we we

330
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,910
0,180 180,345 345,810 810,1100 1300,1700
truly get nonolile storage. But

331
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,615
0,290 290,515 515,850 900,1250 1250,1595
from the design of the,

332
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,400
0,240 240,485 625,1025 1225,1590 1590,1785
the architecture itself we'll assume

333
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,845
0,320 1600,1845 1845,1920 1920,2085 2085,2445
that you know, it's volatile

334
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,160
0,90 90,225 225,390 390,905
versus it non volatile.|

335
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,975
0,350 350,575 575,755 755,935 935,965
Another key difference we're going

336
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:06,785
0,75 75,225 225,405 405,735 735,810
to see between volatile and

337
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,990
0,135 135,605 745,1145 1765,2070 2070,2205
non volatile is how we

338
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,680
0,225 225,510 510,645 645,890
can access the data.|

339
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,075
0,275 275,500 500,965 965,1205 1205,1385
So non volatile storage will

340
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:13,230
0,245 325,600 600,705 705,855 855,1155
be considered to be byte

341
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,380
0,560
addressable.|

342
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,080
0,245 245,320 320,440 440,730
What does that mean?|

343
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,560
0,400 1140,1385 1385,1490 1490,1595 1595,1730
Each, he says, you can

344
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,075
0,225 225,450 450,915 915,1220 1240,1515
query each individualte correct? So

345
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,200
0,225 225,420 420,660 660,900 900,1125
let's say I have one

346
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,770
0,435 435,710 3040,3315 3315,3450 3450,3570
megabyte file. I want to

347
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,210
0,255 255,795 795,1005 1005,1215 1215,1440
get 64 bits at some

348
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,830
0,320 340,740 1060,1335 1335,1485 1485,1620
random offset. I can do

349
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,060
0,165 165,330 330,590
that in memory.|

350
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,845
0,305 305,500 500,785 785,1025 1025,1205
There's cache lines is not

351
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:34,895
0,255 255,495 495,720 720,915 915,1050
exactly true, but for now

352
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:36,700
0,270 270,555 555,720 720,995 1405,1805
we can ignore that in

353
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,270
0,400 450,785 785,1130 1130,1325 1325,1520
a non fossil storage, like,

354
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,160
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,345 345,890
think of it an ssd

355
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,015
0,320 320,665 665,860 860,1160 1160,1505
you can't go get exactly

356
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:41,945
0,465 465,615 615,735 735,810 810,930
64 bits in a one

357
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,280
0,345 345,605
megabyte file.|

358
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,790
0,75 75,180 180,285 285,390 390,510
You got to go get

359
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,620
0,180 180,500 700,960 960,1220 1360,1830
the block that that 64

360
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,895
0,120 120,255 255,530 850,1125 1125,1275
bits is in, bring that

361
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:47,735
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,705 705,840
into memory and then do

362
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:48,700
0,225 225,435 435,555 555,690 690,965
whatever you need on it.|

363
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,445
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,710 710,1025
So you can only address

364
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:54,180
0,365 775,1175 1225,1625 2545,3095
blocks, not individual bytes.|

365
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,645
0,275 275,455 455,590 590,740 740,935
And so the reason why

366
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,565
0,180 180,465 465,720 720,995 1555,1920
this matters is that there'll

367
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,800
0,245 865,1265 1285,1680 1680,1935 1935,2235
be certain algorithms we choose

368
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,730
0,225 225,390 390,630 630,780 780,930
in the design of our

369
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,440
0,320 340,740 940,1245 1245,1485 1485,1710
system where we know we're

370
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,105
0,300 300,590 1120,1365 1365,1485 1485,1665
fetching blocks instead of single

371
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,265
0,485 715,990 990,1170 1170,1595 1825,2160
bytes or byte offsets, and

372
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,240
0,195 195,405 405,600 600,765 765,975
therefore we'll choose maybe an

373
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,335
0,270 270,360 360,525 525,810 810,1095
algorithm that is better for

374
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:09,800
0,225 225,555 555,815
block adjustable data.|

375
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,170
0,320 320,485 485,635 635,890 890,1010
Related to this, we're also

376
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,325
0,75 75,180 180,405 405,770 790,1155
going to choose potentially algorithms

377
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:16,450
0,275 3265,3840 3840,3945 3945,4020 4020,4125
that maximize the amount of

378
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,700
0,435 435,690 690,840 840,975 975,1250
sequential access of our data.|

379
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,580
0,335 335,500 500,545 545,605 605,710
So what do I mean

380
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,800
0,120 120,380
by this?|

381
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,205
0,400 900,1325 1325,1760 1760,1970 1970,2255
Yes, accessing adjacent blocks is

382
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,090
0,360 360,585 585,660 660,765 765,885
cheaper, so we want to

383
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,640
0,150 150,770 880,1125 1125,1260 1260,1550
do sequential. So he said

384
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,765
0,395 395,800 800,1090 1200,1600 1620,1955
accessing adjacent blocks are are

385
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:32,725
0,335 535,765 765,840 840,915 915,960
cheaper. So we want to

386
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:33,400
0,75 75,240 240,420 420,555 555,675
do that as much as

387
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,450
0,225 225,480 480,690 690,900 900,1050
possible. So again, say I

388
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,620
0,105 105,210 210,470
want to get.|

389
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,400
0,150 150,255 255,345 345,540 540,780
I want to get ten

390
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,370
0,620 730,975 975,1095 1095,1370 1570,1970
megabytes and I have in

391
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,590
0,365 365,605 605,740 740,1055 1055,1330
Pro to one megabyte blocks.

392
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,025
0,260 260,425 425,620 620,965 965,1145
If those one megabyte blocks

393
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,170
0,210 210,405 405,540 540,765 765,1145
are scattered in different locations,

394
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,085
0,260 260,515 515,845 845,965 965,1565
then I it's called randomis.

395
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:46,985
0,210 210,435 435,585 585,675 675,900
Go jump to those different

396
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,010
0,300 300,480 480,585 585,735 735,1025
locations to get that data.|

397
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,270
0,320 460,1035 1035,1200 1200,1380 1380,1610
Or alternatively, if it's all

398
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,635
0,470 470,770 770,1450 1650,1910 1910,2075
aligned together, contiguous, then in

399
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:53,505
0,255 255,450 450,540 540,660 660,870
theory I can do one

400
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,140
0,330 330,695 1135,1425 1425,1515 1515,1635
fetch command. I'm not saying

401
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,980
0,120 120,270 270,465 465,690 690,840
what the device is, but

402
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,285
0,150 150,315 315,650 730,1080 1080,1305
it's one fetch command to

403
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,875
0,210 210,465 465,705 705,1025 1315,1590
go get those ten, one

404
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,480
0,285 285,545 1015,1275 1275,1545 1545,1605
meyte blocks and that's gonna

405
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,710
be way more efficient.|

406
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,400
0,400
Right.|

407
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,150
0,230 230,305 305,410 410,530 530,650
If you just think of

408
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,160
0,150 150,285 285,375 375,615 615,1010
like on a website or

409
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,295
0,320 320,485 485,575 575,740 740,905
download something about the Internet,

410
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,020
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,545 1495,1725
if I can go open

411
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,830
0,75 75,180 180,375 375,630 630,810
up a single connection and

412
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,430
0,105 105,225 225,345 345,465 465,600
get all the data I

413
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,300
0,180 180,390 390,600 600,765 765,870
need rather than opening up

414
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,400
0,180 180,500 1390,1695 1695,1890 1890,2100
different connections the the one

415
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,000
0,270 270,450 450,495 495,525 525,600
fetch, it's going to be

416
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,020
0,260
faster.|

417
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,550
0,260 260,395 395,605 605,860 860,1040
At the hardware level, think

418
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,285
0,105 105,210 210,360 360,600 600,735
of like a spinning, just

419
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,500
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,1020 1020,1215
hard drive and laptops don't

420
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,460
0,75 75,150 150,330 330,675 675,960
come with these anymore. They

421
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,495
0,225 225,480 480,660 660,825 825,1035
still exist in the enterprise

422
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,875
0,305 595,840 840,1050 1050,1245 1245,1380
world, but there's, there's a

423
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,915
0,305 325,725 1075,1605 1605,1905 1905,2040
physical arm that's spinning around

424
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,560
0,105 105,195 195,375 375,540 540,645
on a pl, like a

425
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,270
0,300 300,560 970,1290 1290,1530 1530,1710
vinyl record, right? Like that

426
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,670
0,150 150,330 330,620 850,1125 1125,1400
old people have. And so

427
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,030
0,335 335,545 545,710 710,980 980,1280
if you had to plot

428
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,840
0,225 225,375 375,525 525,675 675,810
move the arm to get

429
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,750
0,290 760,1065 1065,1245 1245,1515 1515,1910
data, moving that arm is

430
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,170
0,290 290,395 395,665 665,965 965,1280
it's a physical thing. It's

431
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,475
0,225 225,645 645,885 885,1050 1050,1305
expensive. It's you're actually moving

432
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,325
0,365 745,1145 1195,1595 2155,2625 2625,2850
something through through helium, but

433
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,455
0,285 285,465 465,815 1705,1995 1995,2130
you're moving something, moving the

434
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,440
0,135 135,270 270,375 375,665
arm on the platter.|

435
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,815
0,305 305,485 485,650 650,890 890,1085
If I have to, if

436
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:42,325
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,405 405,510
I can just move the

437
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,240
0,150 150,435 435,660 660,780 780,915
arm once and then read

438
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,245
0,90 90,165 165,285 285,560 700,1005
a bunch of data without

439
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,760
0,180 180,345 345,635 775,1140 1140,1515
moving it again, that's sequential

440
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,620
0,195 195,420 420,465 465,570 570,860
access. That's to be faster.

441
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,560
0,245 245,335 335,425 425,545 545,680
If I had to pick

442
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,160
0,105 105,240 240,390 390,495 495,600
the arm up and move

443
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,020
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,540 540,860
it over and over again,

444
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,160
0,260 260,455 455,560 560,710 710,1060
then that's going much slower.

445
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,600
0,305 305,515 515,770 770,965 965,1270
And again, we'll see this

446
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,880
0,400 660,965 965,1115 1115,1360 1860,2260
when this come up in

447
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,760
0,320 320,605 605,1060 1440,1840 2310,2710
the execution algorithms that certain

448
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,255
0,290 290,395 395,590 590,770 770,935
algorithms will choose that will

449
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,160
0,480 480,840 840,1175
maximize sequential access.|

450
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,180
0,210 210,390 390,555 555,780 780,1020
And we'll choose those over

451
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,110
0,195 195,390 390,495 495,720 720,930
something that's more random access.

452
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,920
0,105 105,225 225,390 390,615 615,810
And this is different than

453
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,880
0,180 180,360 360,495 495,675 675,960
maybe how you think about

454
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,240
0,345 345,620 1210,1635 1635,1910 1960,2360
algorithms in intro classes, because

455
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,800
0,290 290,500 500,725 725,965 965,1300
in that world they assume

456
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,880
0,470 470,620 620,725 725,815 815,1060
everything's always going to be

457
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,420
0,245 245,470 470,710 710,890 890,1070
the memory, access is always

458
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,440
0,135 135,410
the same.|

459
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
0,260 260,440 440,635 725,785 785,920
In our world, we're dealing

460
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,870
0,120 120,255 255,555 555,825 825,990
with real hardware, so we

461
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,740
0,210 210,315 315,480 480,950
can't make that assumption.|

462
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,360
0,320 320,640
Right, so.|

463
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,970
0,305 305,455 455,700 960,1340 1340,1550
I talk about. So the

464
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,570
0,105 105,270 270,360 360,480 480,600
way we'll think about this

465
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,010
0,135 135,410 820,1185 1185,1305 1305,1440
is that I'll use the

466
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,165
0,150 150,440 490,735 735,870 870,1155
term memory in this class

467
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:23,975
0,240 240,405 405,495 495,630 630,810
and I'll just mean here.

468
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,630
0,195 195,285 285,545 895,1275 1275,1655
I'll just mean mean dram.

469
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,710
0,245 245,335 335,455 455,650 650,1100
And when I say disk,

470
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,400
0,135 135,165 165,210 210,420 420,690
I'm going to mean anything

471
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,140
0,270 270,650 730,1130 1420,1665 1665,1740
below that, right? So an

472
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
0,560 1150,1425 1425,1560 1560,1710 1710,2000
ssd spending this hard drive

473
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,090
0,305 305,485 485,710 710,965 965,1270
or a network cloud storage.|

474
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,435
0,400 540,890 890,1085 1085,1205 1205,1355
The, the, the ones up

475
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:38,055
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,1025 1345,1620
here, the cpu registers, we

476
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:39,000
0,255 255,465 465,630 630,780 780,945
won't discuss these in this

477
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,665
0,290 580,980 1060,1320 1320,1455 1455,1665
class. EM, in the advanced

478
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:41,610
0,255 255,480 480,600 600,720 720,945
class we'll talk about different

479
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,800
0,315 315,420 420,540 540,795 795,1190
algorithms of the methods to

480
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,145
0,230 230,365 365,935 935,1100 1100,1235
try to maximize the amount

481
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:45,135
0,135 135,395 415,720 720,870 870,990
of processing being do of

482
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,090
0,275 655,990 990,1290 1290,1680 1680,1955
data in cp registers or

483
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,920
0,350 350,700 840,1145 1145,1310 1310,1810
l three l two caches.|

484
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,215
0,105 105,210 210,360 360,600 600,795
And in that world, you

485
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:50,880
0,75 75,165 165,270 270,390 390,665
can make a huge difference.|

486
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,915
0,365 365,545 545,695 695,950 950,1055
It's also worth noting there

487
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,110
0,195 195,545 1255,1590 1590,1860 1860,2195
are some emerging hardware devices

488
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,245
0,275 275,440 440,650 650,815 815,1115
or hardware that's available today

489
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:00,420
0,315 315,665 1735,2040 2040,2495
that spans different layers.|

490
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,975
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,790 840,1085
So you can get sort

491
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,610
0,120 120,375 375,720 720,1085 1375,1635
of fast network storage or

492
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,280
0,540 540,810 810,1020 1020,1395 1395,1670
disaggregated storage or disaggregated memory

493
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,280
0,260 260,485 485,845 845,1240
where this looks like.|

494
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,775
0,305 305,515 515,800 800,1055 1055,1295
It could potentially could be

495
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,365
0,315 315,870 870,1080 1080,1335 1335,1590
by addressable, but you're going

496
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,225
0,335 355,755 1045,1380 1380,1680 1680,1860
over a physical network so

497
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:13,890
0,120 120,165 165,240 240,360 360,665
it's a little bit slower.

498
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,375
0,400 480,770 770,905 905,1025 1025,1265
So it sort of straddles

499
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,610
0,165 165,405 405,725 1855,2115 2115,2235
in between here and then

500
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,720
0,105 105,210 210,420 420,660 660,1110
there was something called persistent

501
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,345
0,260 820,1220 1900,2220 2220,2385 2385,2625
memory that people have been

502
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,290
0,405 405,570 570,675 675,765 765,945
dreaming about for a long

503
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,710
0,320 610,1010 1480,1770 1770,2040 2040,2420
time. That would have the

504
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
0,400 1500,1790 1790,1925 1925,2060 2060,2480
benefits have the by addressability

505
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,485
0,165 165,315 315,590 760,1080 1080,1245
of d dram but also

506
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:32,230
0,105 105,660 660,995 1495,1895 2485,2745
the persistence of of an

507
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,850
0,560 970,1215 1215,1290 1290,1425 1425,1620
ssd and it would actually

508
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,675
0,150 150,240 240,345 345,555 555,825
sit in the dim slot.

509
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:35,515
0,165 165,285 285,435 435,660 660,840
So you could write to

510
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,750
0,245 385,675 675,840 840,975 975,1235
it as if it was

511
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,560
0,365 365,560 560,620 620,725 725,860
memory, but if you pull

512
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,230
0,135 135,410 880,1140 1140,1260 1260,1670
the plug, everything gets retained.|

513
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,020
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,650 650,770
And this is something when

514
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,235
0,165 165,345 345,590 760,1035 1035,1215
I, when I first started

515
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:46,000
0,480 480,875 2005,2265 2265,2445 2445,2765
cmu, eh, ten years ago,

516
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,735
0,275 275,455 455,635 635,725 725,785
we were spending a lot

517
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:48,815
0,105 105,255 255,645 645,855 855,1080
of time researching this. This

518
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:49,550
0,120 120,270 270,405 405,495 495,735
is something that was very

519
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,020
0,225 225,470 550,950 1060,1320 1320,1470
interesting about, because if we

520
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,230
0,225 225,450 450,855 855,1100 1810,2210
had this persistent memory, basically

521
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,140
0,290 290,470 470,620 620,725 725,860
all the stuff that I'm

522
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,340
0,45 45,105 105,270 270,590
going to talk about.|

523
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,900
0,290 290,425 425,635 635,965 965,1310
In two weeks, actually, project

524
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,175
0,380 430,675 675,795 795,990 990,1275
one in this class basically

525
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,520
0,300 300,635
goes away.|

526
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,415
0,320 320,470 470,545 545,695 695,785
Right, because I don't need

527
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:01,150
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,540 540,735
to worry about moving things

528
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,010
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,390 390,860
in and out of disk.

529
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,440
0,305 305,470 470,1000
Memory is persistent.|

530
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,635
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,880 1110,1385
They might know if anybody

531
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:07,910
0,195 195,375 375,525 525,815 985,1275
actually to make this this

532
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,680
0,420 420,795 795,1040
persistent nonalim memory.|

533
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,450
0,400 4800,5105 5105,5270 5270,5375 5375,5620
Yes, boom. There you go.

534
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,345
0,290 290,440 440,605 605,910 960,1205
Yes. So he said you

535
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:19,975
0,105 105,270 270,435 435,540 540,630
could try this with an

536
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,025
0,510 510,780 780,915 915,990 990,1050
ssd asked people to do

537
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:21,865
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,630 630,840
that, but that's not true

538
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,620
0,330 330,575 1045,1395 1395,1620 1620,1755
persistent memory. Or then you

539
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,285
0,120 120,375 375,800 940,1320 1320,1665
said Intel octane. Intel octane

540
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:26,440
0,195 195,315 315,435 435,960 960,1155
actually was an ssd. It

541
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,730
0,180 180,530 580,900 900,1110 1110,1290
was actually phase change memory.

542
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,765
0,210 210,420 420,600 600,765 765,1035
It actually was a physical

543
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,325
0,345 345,570 570,735 735,1025 1255,1560
device that could do was

544
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:31,440
0,405 405,665
persistent memory.|

545
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,615
0,290 700,1215 1215,1365 1365,1965 1965,2175
Right, HP had memoryisters. There

546
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,090
0,245 265,780 780,1050 1050,1185 1185,1475
was. IBM rumored has something.

547
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,390
0,425 425,515 515,605 605,770 770,950
Intel is the only one

548
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,940
0,210 210,405 405,540 540,830
that actually made this.|

549
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,340
0,275 275,410 410,620 620,830 830,920
Who here has heard of

550
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,005
0,225 225,650 1030,1290 1290,1455 1455,1665
Intel octane? Well, he obviously

551
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,060
0,305 475,810 810,1050 1050,1355
yes. Very, very few.|

552
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,835
0,425 425,680 680,815 815,1120 1560,1805
It's, it's already dead. So

553
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:46,890
0,270 270,450 450,585 585,750 750,1055
Intel killed it last year.

554
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,765
0,400 870,1295 1295,1445 1445,1565 1565,1685
Basically, Intel hired a new

555
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,130
0,390 390,755 865,1155 1155,1290 1290,1365
CEO and they cut a

556
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,170
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,720 720,1040
bunch of divisions and unfortunately,

557
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,665
0,260 260,395 395,650 650,875 875,995
they cut this. And this

558
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:54,505
0,255 255,375 375,540 540,690 690,840
sucks because like, to me,

559
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,035
0,180 180,345 345,635 1135,1410 1410,1530
this is like, this would

560
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:56,815
0,75 75,150 150,240 240,405 405,780
have been a game changer,

561
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,525
0,305 445,1055 1165,1485 1485,1575 1575,1710
but Intel couldn't make any

562
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,515
0,150 150,285 285,390 390,635 745,990
money off of it. And

563
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:00,370
0,105 105,375 375,585 585,735 735,855
what sucks also too is

564
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,270
0,195 195,480 480,690 690,840 840,900
like now no one's going

565
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,975
0,105 105,255 255,390 390,510 510,705
to try this for another

566
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:04,300
0,335 895,1295 1615,1875 1875,2190 2190,2325
decade because if Intel could

567
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,130
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,585 585,830
make money off of it.|

568
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,400
0,255 255,530 820,1220
Who will right?|

569
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,960
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,880 960,1310
But there was a various

570
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,550
0,350 580,855 855,1050 1050,1305 1305,1590
projects at different database companies.

571
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,470
0,195 195,345 345,495 495,630 630,920
They were trying to build

572
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,465
0,335 335,670 810,1210 1440,1840 2220,2705
data systems just around persistent

573
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:15,950
0,245 505,795 795,1020 1020,1275 1275,1485
memory because again, a bunch

574
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,490
0,135 135,225 225,330 330,450 450,540
of the stuff we had

575
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,195
0,60 60,165 165,285 285,465 465,705
to do with moving data

576
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:18,755
0,165 165,300 300,495 495,815 1225,1560
back and forth between disk

577
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,150
0,75 75,335 565,900 900,1170 1170,1395
and memory goes away with

578
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,880
0,290 910,1200 1200,1410 1410,1485 1485,1730
this. So that's a shame.|

579
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,300
0,400
Okay.|

580
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,195
0,380 380,620 620,830 830,1100 1100,1265
So the reason why we

581
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,155
0,105 105,195 195,330 330,810 810,960
have to be cognizant of

582
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:27,845
0,165 165,330 330,480 480,615 615,690
what the storage are going

583
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:28,835
0,75 75,225 225,435 435,705 705,990
to look like is because

584
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,265
0,315 315,630 630,1385 2005,2280 2280,2430
the performance characteristics, as I

585
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,225
0,225 225,420 420,525 525,690 690,960
said, between these different devices

586
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,650
0,225 225,300 300,360 360,605 925,1425
are going to be dramatically

587
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,780
0,380
different.|

588
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,165
0,365 365,620 620,680 680,815 815,1025
And we're going to try

589
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,295
0,225 225,965 1495,1770 1770,1950 1950,2130
to maximize the amount of

590
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,210
0,180 180,345 345,480 480,690 690,915
work we can do for

591
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,650
0,290 610,885 885,1065 1065,1185 1185,1440
data when it's in memory,

592
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,895
0,225 225,330 330,480 480,770 970,1245
when we bring something off

593
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,095
0,135 135,345 345,450 450,725 955,1200
a disk into memory, we

594
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:43,620
0,75 75,135 135,225 225,360 360,525
want to do as much

595
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,450
0,150 150,270 270,405 405,555 555,830
work as we can on

596
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,155
0,400 420,680 680,815 815,1090 1350,1685
that, on that data before

597
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,130
0,270 270,465 465,600 600,795 795,975
we throw it away and

598
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,050
0,150 150,330 330,495 495,645 645,920
bring something else into memory.|

599
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,915
0,240 240,375 375,585 585,885 885,1215
Right. In an ideal world

600
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,070
0,285 285,540 540,765 765,930 930,1155
our database would fit entirely

601
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,615
0,165 165,410 970,1260 1260,1410 1410,1545
in memory. Even then you

602
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:53,170
0,120 120,210 210,315 315,435 435,555
have to write out the

603
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,025
0,300 300,405 405,510 510,645 645,855
disk, but in some cases

604
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,970
0,615 615,735 735,900 900,1175 2545,2945
that's not always possible. So

605
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,110
0,245 245,335 335,485 485,680 680,970
the way to this at

606
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,625
0,290 290,605 605,880 960,1360 2190,2465
the cpu level, right? A

607
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,390
0,240 240,465 465,615 615,705 705,765
cache Miss is going to

608
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,000
0,230 340,615 615,840 840,1080 1080,1610
basically is going one nanosecond.

609
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,255
0,290 290,440 440,560 560,695 695,845
Getting out of d dram

610
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,205
0,165 165,455 505,810 810,1565 1705,1950
is hundred hundred nanoseconds and

611
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,695
0,495 495,645 645,905 1015,1415 1855,2490
ssd is about sixteen microconds

612
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:10,330
0,120 120,525 525,1140 1140,1500 1500,1635
or 16,000 nanoseconds. That's actually

613
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,785
0,150 150,440 790,1140 1140,1275 1275,1455
pretty good. Spinning Dis hard

614
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,770
0,305 625,960 960,1155 1155,1305 1305,1985
drive two, two million nanoseconds

615
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,685
0,245 245,490 540,1175 1175,1415 1415,1895
and then ebs can fluctuate.

616
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:16,810
0,195 195,315 315,420 420,585 585,1125
Sometimes you get fifty milliseconds,

617
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,300
0,150 150,300 300,525 525,930 930,1490
sometimes you get 500 milliseconds,

618
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,570
0,275 275,545 545,890 890,1100 1100,1220
depends on how hot the

619
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,845
0,150 150,440 550,795 795,1020 1020,1275
data is and then tape

620
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,440
0,390 390,645 645,810 810,1085
archives. Again this is.|

621
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,015
0,260 260,520 720,1130 1130,1310 1310,1565
This is glacial. You don't,

622
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:24,630
0,75 75,180 180,225 225,405 405,615
you don't want to Don

623
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,115
0,135 135,300 300,480 480,770 1240,1485
any system off this. So

624
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,735
0,225 225,585 585,965 985,1320 1320,1620
this, this data comes from

625
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,460
0,365 1015,1305 1305,1485 1485,1620 1620,1725
eh this particular day. Here

626
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,495
0,225 225,495 495,585 585,855 855,1035
comes there's a Berkeley website

627
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:31,635
0,165 165,240 240,390 390,695 865,1140
and a link there. He

628
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:32,205
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,450 450,570
sort of shows you the

629
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,260
0,180 180,315 315,405 405,660 660,1055
trends of the hardware performance

630
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,500
0,275 275,455 455,680 680,950 950,1100
or the the speeds of

631
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,420
0,225 225,450 450,675 675,980 1390,1920
these devices over time. It's

632
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,770
0,360 360,735 735,1020 1020,1170 1170,1350
this. This table has been

633
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,105
0,300 300,465 465,645 645,980 1090,1335
attributed to Jeff dean from

634
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:40,860
0,75 75,210 210,375 375,635 1435,1755
the early two thousands. I

635
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,865
0,320 340,600 600,720 720,840 840,1005
actually I think it might

636
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:43,970
0,330 330,635 805,1125 1125,1445 1705,2105
predate him before that, um,

637
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,615
0,260 260,365 365,500 500,790 870,1265
and so as humans it's

638
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:46,335
0,165 165,285 285,375 375,495 495,720
hard for us to reason

639
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,285
0,285 285,930 930,1205 1525,1800 1800,1950
about nanoseconds, right? Like one

640
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,365
0,450 450,630 630,720 720,885 885,1080
nanosecond. What does that actually

641
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,220
0,165 165,345 345,525 525,660 660,855
mean or, or, you {know2

642
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,420
0,225 225,390 390,945 945,1095 1095,1200
-} million nanoseconds. Is that

643
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,280
0,105 105,225 225,500
a long time?|

644
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,645
0,400 660,935 935,1055 1055,1220 1220,1325
EM, and so there's a

645
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,355
0,275 925,1215 1215,1350 1350,1500 1500,1710
simple trick you can do

646
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,200
0,300 300,600 600,905 985,1385 1555,1845
to realize how much, how

647
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,190
0,180 180,420 420,615 615,795 795,990
bad this actually is, or

648
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,045
0,105 105,225 225,435 435,660 660,855
how much slower things actually

649
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:00,580
0,275 595,870 870,990 990,1185 1185,1535
get if you just change

650
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,380
0,290 290,770 770,965 965,1190 1190,1540
one nanosecond to one second.|

651
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,745
0,400 1050,1295 1295,1400 1400,1505 1505,1625
Right. So this is a

652
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:06,830
0,165 165,455 655,915 915,1175 1795,2085
trick that this is something

653
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,550
0,165 165,330 330,480 480,600 600,720
that Jim grey used to

654
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,530
0,210 210,420 420,525 525,675 675,980
do in the ninety s

655
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,625
0,245 245,335 335,485 485,790 1350,1625
if you just change one

656
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,990
0,330 330,450 450,585 585,875 1045,1365
nanosecond to one second, now

657
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,105
0,225 225,530 640,960 960,1640 1720,2115
you see how massively slower

658
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,425
0,195 195,390 390,645 645,965 1045,1320
these other devices are. You

659
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,115
0,180 180,390 390,525 525,600 600,690
see why you want to

660
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,060
0,195 195,435 435,600 600,780 780,945
keep everything in memory as

661
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,260
0,120 120,270 270,560
much as possible.|

662
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,240
0,400 870,1130 1130,1390 1500,1775 1775,1970
Right. And so you think,

663
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,035
0,255 255,435 435,555 555,675 675,795
like if I have to

664
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:21,815
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,675 675,780
read a page from a

665
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,890
0,275 1075,1365 1365,1635 1635,1845 1845,2075
book and say, you know,

666
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,055
0,320 320,515 515,665 665,905 905,1115
doing l one cache Miss

667
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:25,760
0,105 105,195 195,360 360,540 540,705
would be like me walking

668
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,570
0,135 135,255 255,465 465,660 660,810
at this table and looking

669
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,160
0,135 135,240 240,500 820,1220 1360,1590
in the book, right? Or

670
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,595
0,75 75,150 150,210 210,300 300,435
if I have to read

671
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,365
0,120 120,180 180,725 925,1325 1495,1770
from an ssd or dram,

672
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,130
0,135 135,300 300,480 480,675 675,765
maybe it's walking over to

673
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,910
0,75 75,285 285,495 495,600 600,780
the library and then finding

674
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,905
0,180 180,440 1510,1785 1785,1905 1905,1995
the book. But if I

675
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:34,400
0,75 75,150 150,270 270,390 390,495
have to read from a

676
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,645
0,135 135,510 510,735 735,1050 1050,1245
tape archive, it's 31 years.

677
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:37,070
0,330 330,495 495,785 865,1200 1200,1425
That's equivalent to flying to

678
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,960
0,470 760,1035 1035,1310 1540,1785 1785,1890
Pluto, the planet, and then

679
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,145
0,165 165,360 360,650 880,1110 1110,1185
reading one book. So we

680
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:41,075
0,90 90,240 240,525 525,780 780,930
want to avoid all of

681
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:41,890
0,150 150,285 285,405 405,540 540,815
this as much as possible.|

682
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,260
0,400
Right.|

683
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,400
0,275 275,395 395,710 710,875 875,1100
So the sequential versus random,

684
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,735
0,435 435,585 585,780 780,1080 1080,1335
we've occurred this, we, we

685
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:48,680
0,135 135,285 285,570 570,825 825,945
discussed this already but again

686
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,070
0,105 105,210 210,285 285,330 330,390
this is going to be

687
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,350
0,75 75,570 570,890 1270,1670 1990,2280
a reoccurring theme, eh, throughout

688
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,430
0,150 150,300 300,615 615,840 840,1080
the entire semester where again

689
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,335
0,380 820,1080 1080,1305 1305,1650 1650,1905
the the database system is

690
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,550
0,105 105,165 165,395 445,960 960,1215
going to prefer sequential access

691
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,705
0,255 255,555 555,825 825,990 990,1155
over random access for both

692
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:59,120
0,195 195,285 285,545 1885,2190 2190,2415
reads and writes. When spinning

693
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,915
0,105 105,255 255,465 465,675 675,795
gets hard drives, again it

694
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:00,905
0,120 120,255 255,405 405,695 745,990
makes a huge difference. But

695
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,615
0,135 135,285 285,875 1375,1620 1620,1710
even on ssd because of

696
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,560
0,75 75,210 210,465 465,750 750,945
the way they they actually

697
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,505
0,150 150,360 360,525 525,735 735,945
work underneath the covers with

698
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:05,285
0,75 75,405 405,525 525,600 600,780
the asx and then doing

699
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,890
0,375 375,570 570,690 690,965 1225,1605
compaction and so forth, you're

700
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,245
0,210 210,345 345,510 510,800 2020,2355
you're better off doing batch

701
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,640
0,240 240,510 510,1080 1080,1275 1275,1395
region writes sequentially as much

702
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,580
0,120 120,380
as possible.|

703
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,040
0,400
Right.|

704
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,700
0,320 320,485 485,575 575,725 725,980
Right. So the other system

705
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,390
0,255 255,435 435,585 585,630 630,690
design goals we're going to

706
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,010
0,230 490,765 765,900 900,1160 1330,1620
have and how we choose

707
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,520
0,135 135,225 225,315 315,405 405,510
how we want to build

708
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,145
0,135 135,410 1660,1935 1935,2210 2350,2625
our system is that we

709
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:23,020
0,120 120,225 225,360 360,480 480,875
want to give the illusion

710
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,550
0,400 720,1120 1500,1865 1865,2135 2135,2300
that we are operating with

711
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,800
0,105 105,350 400,765 765,990 990,1250
the Davis entirely in memory.|

712
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,910
0,395 395,790 1260,1550 1550,1955 1955,2090
Again, for most databases aren't

713
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,870
0,135 135,345 345,525 525,825 825,960
that big. Most databases are

714
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,520
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,1040
less than ten gigabytes.|

715
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,485
0,350 550,950 1150,1470 1470,1695 1695,1965
Right. Uh, but really massive

716
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:36,600
0,630 630,935 1045,1320 1320,1770 1770,2115
databases like the terabytes, gigabytes

717
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,210
0,90 90,495 495,1100 1150,1550 1960,2610
and terabytes, petabytes EM, ideally

718
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,200
0,135 135,330 330,585 585,780 780,990
you want to give the

719
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,740
0,350 430,830
appearance that.|

720
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,670
0,230 230,305 305,440 440,575 575,800
Everything is already in memory,

721
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,980
0,285 285,525 525,780 780,945 1050,1310
even though it actually isn't.|

722
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,445
0,75 75,150 150,360 360,465 465,555
And there's tricks we can

723
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,495
0,105 105,225 225,405 405,585 585,1050
do to hide the distalss

724
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:47,740
0,180 180,315 315,575
and so forth.|

725
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,010
0,260 260,520 540,940 1320,1625 1625,1850
And then, as since reading

726
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,170
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,825 825,1160
writing disk is so expensive,

727
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,985
0,395 395,650 650,905 905,1145 1145,1235
we want to do a

728
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:54,735
0,105 105,195 195,375 375,660 660,750
bunch of other tricks in

729
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:55,550
0,165 165,345 345,435 435,540 540,815
our design of our system

730
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,260
0,400 420,820
to avoid.|

731
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,090
0,530 530,1060 1080,1340 1340,1520 1520,1700
Prolonged stalls or having the

732
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,980
0,240 240,525 525,1310
system appear unresponsive.|

733
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,690
0,350 350,650 650,905 905,1220 1220,1520
Right, because one that'll frustrate

734
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,725
0,255 255,495 495,630 630,915 915,1035
the application or frustrate the

735
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,850
0,180 180,360 360,605 745,1005 1005,1125
user because they think the

736
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,010
0,465 465,860 1690,1935 1935,2055 2055,2160
system's stuck, but you're really

737
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,615
0,315 315,435 435,570 570,1040 1360,1605
fetching things from disk. But

738
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,290
0,225 225,435 435,525 525,615 615,675
this also is going to

739
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,805
0,120 120,315 315,615 615,1010 1240,1515
cause other problems because if

740
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:11,750
0,210 210,405 405,615 615,750 750,945
we're holding like a lock

741
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,785
0,225 225,465 465,645 645,780 780,1035
on something and we stall

742
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,415
0,255 255,390 390,465 465,525 525,630
because we have to get

743
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,195
0,165 165,330 330,555 555,645 645,780
something from disk or write

744
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,000
0,180 180,375 375,905 1165,1560 1560,1805
something from disk, that's gonna

745
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,285
0,275 275,470 470,650 650,845 845,1055
slow down everybody else behind

746
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:18,120
0,275
us.|

747
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,475
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,785 785,995
And have a convoy effect.

748
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,315
0,210 210,450 450,525 525,660 660,840
So there's a bunch of,

749
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:21,740
0,150 150,395 895,1140 1140,1260 1260,1425
you know, for this reason

750
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,430
0,150 150,285 285,375 375,540 540,690
we want to avoid this

751
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,840
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,620
as much as possible.|

752
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,675
0,275 275,545 545,940 1020,1400 1400,1685
And again, because random access

753
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:27,070
0,305 505,855 855,1005 1005,1080 1080,1395
is slower than its sequential

754
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,480
0,320 670,915 915,1005 1005,1080 1080,1410
access, we want to maximize

755
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
0,375 375,710
sequential access.|

756
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,260
0,230 230,305 305,395 395,500 500,680
So what does this all

757
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
0,225 225,530
sound like?|

758
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,445
0,320 320,515 515,790 930,1160 1160,1265
Having the appearance, we have

759
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:37,375
0,180 180,405 405,570 570,735 735,930
more memory than we actually

760
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,320
0,275
do.|

761
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,215
0,305 305,610 1470,1685 1685,1775 1775,1835
Virtual memory, so we'll get

762
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,565
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,545 1015,1350
this in a second. I'll

763
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,360
0,180 180,390 390,555 555,735 735,795
explain why we don't want

764
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,185
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,600 600,825
to do virtual memory from

765
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,090
0,135 135,425 625,885 885,1145 1645,1905
the OS and why, as

766
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,040
0,120 120,315 315,650 1000,1400 1660,1950
a database system developer, engineer

767
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,690
0,195 195,405 405,570 570,830 1300,1650
building the actual system, we

768
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,545
0,240 240,375 375,480 480,660 660,855
always want to do as

769
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:51,895
0,135 135,270 270,450 450,755 1045,1350
much as we can ourselves

770
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:52,915
0,300 300,600 600,780 780,900 900,1020
and not rely on the

771
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,120
0,135 135,240 240,450 450,815
OS to do anything.|

772
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,695
0,400 510,890 890,1265 1265,1505 1505,1625
So hi, this is our

773
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,385
0,345 345,435 435,495 495,570 570,690
diagram. This is what we're

774
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,410
0,215 685,975 975,1125 1125,1385 1735,2025
building. So we have some

775
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,350
0,290 340,705 705,975 975,1280 1390,1940
database file or files, plural.

776
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,670
0,260 260,470 470,700 1290,1535 1535,1670
It doesn't matter. We can

777
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,245
0,285 285,525 525,770 1210,1455 1455,1575
discuss the differences. We have

778
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,655
0,135 135,395 415,815 985,1290 1290,1410
some database file that's on

779
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,170
0,545 805,1155 1155,1380 1380,1425 1425,1515
disk and we're going to

780
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,940
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,450 450,770
break it up into pages.|

781
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,635
0,245 245,530 530,740 740,830 830,905
And I'll describe what a

782
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:12,435
0,240 240,635 655,915 915,1175 1525,1800
page in a second, and

783
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,530
0,165 165,255 255,465 465,900 900,1095
there'll be some directory that's

784
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,130
0,60 60,150 150,300 300,510 510,600
going to say, here's what

785
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,195
0,195 195,405 405,660 660,975 975,1065
pages I have, here's where

786
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:16,035
0,105 105,240 240,465 465,705 705,840
to find them. That's all

787
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,280
0,165 165,270 270,405 405,695
set and so forth.|

788
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,790
0,275 275,470 470,680 680,815 815,1120
And then there'll be some

789
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,730
0,425 425,700 1110,1510 2010,2300 2300,2590
buffer pool where of memory,

790
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,140
0,230 230,335 335,485 485,605 605,1060
the data system is allocated,

791
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,560
0,365 365,620 620,935 935,1085 1085,1250
basically called malloc against the

792
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,645
0,290 520,825 825,990 990,1250 1810,2085
OS, got some memory. And

793
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:27,230
0,135 135,270 270,315 315,405 405,585
then we're going to use

794
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,480
0,270 270,510 510,675 675,1005 1005,1250
that as the staging area

795
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,705
0,260 260,410 410,620 620,875 875,1175
where we bring pages in

796
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,060
0,345 345,875
from disk.|

797
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,520
0,245 245,365 365,500 500,710 710,980
So now if the execution

798
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,585
0,300 300,525 525,630 630,900 900,1065
engine, the thing that's going

799
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:34,440
0,105 105,225 225,360 360,600 600,855
to run, our query comes

800
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,795
0,320 670,1070 1660,1995 1995,2220 2220,2355
along and it wants to

801
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,360
0,135 135,330 330,570 570,905
get page number two.|

802
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,950
0,225 225,390 390,660 660,1010 1300,1590
We can ignore how it

803
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,895
0,225 225,405 405,555 555,750 750,945
knows. It wants page number

804
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:43,175
0,305 1165,1410 1410,1655 1795,2085 2085,2280
two for now, but assumes

805
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:43,880
0,195 195,255 255,330 330,495 495,705
that's what it wants, one

806
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,160
0,150 150,330 330,650
page number two.|

807
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,940
0,225 225,315 315,465 465,645 645,780
So the very first thing

808
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,480
0,105 105,180 180,255 255,375 375,540
we got to do is

809
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,515
0,150 150,270 270,375 375,570 570,1035
bring in the page directory,

810
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,130
0,180 180,345 345,405 405,495 495,615
because that's going to tell

811
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,950
0,260 640,1040 1240,1515 1515,1790 2560,2820
us where, where on the

812
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,750
0,195 195,530 1000,1275 1275,1500 1500,1800
pages are, and then it'll

813
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,800
0,90 90,225 225,500 550,840 840,1050
make a call to the

814
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,465
0,320 760,1095 1095,1320 1320,1500 1500,1665
OS or whatever the device

815
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,055
0,120 120,330 330,705 705,1025 1345,1590
it is that's storing the

816
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,375
0,210 210,575 745,990 990,1170 1170,1320
database file. And I'll bring

817
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,200
0,305 325,690 690,960 960,1265
that page into memory.|

818
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
0,225 225,375 375,680 880,1280 1390,1800
And then now the buffer

819
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,990
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,690 690,990
pull will give back the

820
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,690
0,270 270,590 1120,1455 1455,2000 2410,2700
execution engine, a pointer in

821
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,965
0,225 225,420 420,780 780,930 930,1275
memory, a 64 bit pointer

822
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,590
0,165 165,425 655,945 945,1230 1230,1625
in memory of where this

823
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,940
0,350 350,700
page exists.|

824
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,165
0,275 275,425 425,575 575,650 650,755
And now it's up to

825
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,140
0,165 165,420 420,660 660,810 810,975
the execution engine or the

826
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,505
0,180 180,360 360,525 525,920 1120,1365
access method, the operators to

827
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,660
0,195 195,495 495,825 825,990 990,1155
then interpret what's inside that

828
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,740
0,290
page.|

829
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,450
0,165 165,315 315,740 880,1425 1425,1710
Because all that's opaque to

830
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,680
0,380 550,855 855,1005 1005,1125 1125,1230
the, to the rest of

831
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,160
0,90 90,315 315,510 510,800
the system, they don't.|

832
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:21,985
0,60 60,195 195,390 390,555 555,780
It's not entirely true, but

833
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:22,660
0,225 225,345 345,465 465,555 615,675
at this point they don't

834
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,980
0,120 120,285 285,560
really need know.|

835
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,910
0,195 195,315 315,585 585,750 750,930
And then let's say once

836
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,330
0,90 90,135 135,180 180,255 255,420
you do a bunch of

837
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,845
0,315 315,645 645,930 930,1215 1215,1515
updates, it makes makes changes

838
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:27,895
0,240 240,465 465,630 630,855 855,1050
to whatever's in page number

839
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,110
0,305 445,750 750,870 870,1065 1065,1215
two, I'm not saying whether

840
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,770
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,570 570,660
it's a tool. I'm not

841
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,400
0,135 135,255 255,375 375,465 465,630
saying where it's an index,

842
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,680
0,135 135,345 345,590
it doesn't matter.|

843
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,840
0,260 260,395 395,590 590,755 755,890
And then now the data

844
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,325
0,165 165,390 390,705 705,1070 1180,1485
system is responsible for writing

845
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,645
0,195 195,375 375,615 615,915 915,1320
this back out to disk

846
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,380
0,105 105,210 210,330 330,495 495,735
to make sure that any

847
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,820
0,225 225,390 390,950
changes are persistent.|

848
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,895
0,245 245,365 365,545 545,725 725,905
So this is, this is

849
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:40,885
0,285 285,510 510,660 660,810 810,990
effectively where we're going for

850
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:41,830
0,75 75,305 475,720 720,825 825,945
the next three or four

851
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,770
0,440 1180,1455 1455,1575 1575,1680 1680,1940
lectures. This is the architecture

852
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,790
0,290 290,335 335,395 395,515 515,790
we're going to be building.

853
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,080
0,400 690,1055 1055,1265 1265,1460 1460,1700
So we'll discuss what pages

854
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,000
0,240 240,530 1030,1430 1480,1740 1740,1920
look like in the next

855
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,930
0,195 195,495 495,690 690,825 825,930
three lectures, three, four and

856
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,270
0,260 700,1095 1095,1430 1900,2190 2190,2340
five, we'll discuss how to

857
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,095
0,165 165,345 345,510 510,660 660,825
write things out the Dis

858
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,795
0,225 225,545 1645,1980 1980,2315 2455,2700
in six and what, how

859
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:56,730
0,75 75,225 225,450 450,645 645,935
to manage memory in six,

860
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,300
0,260 260,365 365,590 590,875 875,1100
and then we'll discuss how

861
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,920
0,180 180,375 375,495 495,920 1330,1620
to execute the queries here

862
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,100
0,180 180,330 330,465 465,740
in twelve and thirteen.|

863
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,720
0,230 230,335 335,560 560,830 830,1130
So our focus really today

864
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,860
0,380
is.|

865
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,520
0,260 260,380 380,560 560,830 830,1070
What are these things on

866
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
0,500
disk?|

867
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,020
0,400
Okay.|

868
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,695
0,230 230,320 320,440 440,700 780,1025
So I said before, what

869
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:13,060
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,695
does this sound like?|

870
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,845
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,880 1470,1685
Everyone said virtual memory and

871
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:16,555
0,75 75,270 270,495 495,785 1375,1710
you say, OK, well why

872
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:18,190
0,335 835,1170 1170,1380 1380,1500 1500,1635
do, why take the next

873
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,965
0,165 165,495 495,705 705,1010 2530,2775
three lectures talking about you

874
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:21,985
0,120 120,285 285,540 540,825 825,1020
need this lecture? Why take

875
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:23,290
0,120 120,365 655,915 915,1155 1155,1305
the next two lectures after

876
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,280
0,290 430,675 675,780 780,885 885,990
that? Talk about how to

877
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,195
0,210 210,465 465,645 645,780 780,915
manage memory back and forth

878
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,425
0,135 135,635 655,900 900,1050 1050,1230
from disk when the OS

879
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,150
0,105 105,195 195,315 315,450 450,725
can do that for us.|

880
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,215
0,215 215,395 395,635 635,860 860,965
Do you know what's the

881
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,030
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,555 555,815
sysc call you would use

882
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,390
0,400 540,815 815,980 980,1160 1160,1280
to use virtual memory in

883
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,300
0,105 105,380
this way?|

884
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,930
0,290 290,580 780,1175 1175,1570 2100,2420
And map. Beautiful, excellent memory

885
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,310
0,225 225,530 910,1155 1155,1260 1260,1380
map file. So this is

886
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,960
0,90 90,195 195,450 450,830 1330,1650
in the POS. Standard Windows

887
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,785
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,660 660,825
has their own version of

888
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,225
0,245 505,765 765,960 960,1245 1245,1440
it, but this allows you

889
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,680
0,105 105,365 505,900 900,1365 1365,1455
to take the contents of

890
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
0,105 105,285 285,480 480,600 600,1160
a file that's on disk

891
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,335
0,320 320,590 590,860 860,1040 1040,1265
and you map it into

892
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:47,710
0,315 315,665 1705,1965 1965,2100 2100,2375
virtual memory in your process,

893
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,950
0,245 245,365 365,635 635,890 890,1010
in the address of your

894
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,780
0,260 910,1185 1185,1350 1350,1590 1590,1830
process. And then now that

895
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,630
0,290 310,710 1150,1440 1440,1590 1590,1850
process can jump to any

896
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,670
0,305 305,500 500,790 1110,1430 1430,1750
offset in that address space

897
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,100
0,260 260,520
in memory.|

898
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,470
0,285 285,585 585,810 810,1035 1035,1370
And the OS is responsible

899
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,740
0,245 245,575 575,890 890,1115 1115,1250
for deciding, oh, is the

900
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,505
0,135 135,270 270,435 435,600 600,765
thing you need in memory

901
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,825
0,165 165,425 655,960 960,1170 1170,1320
or not? If not, then

902
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:01,700
0,105 105,240 240,345 345,615 615,875
it goes and fetches the

903
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,730
0,305 305,455 455,620 620,800 800,920
page you need and brings

904
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,840
0,105 105,195 195,440
it in memory.|

905
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,460
0,400
Right.|

906
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,600
0,245 245,350 350,575 575,845 845,1070
So the database system doesn

907
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,425
0,180 180,330 330,495 495,645 645,825
is not doing any of

908
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:08,970
0,180 180,455 775,1020 1020,1265 1285,1545
the reason. It just m

909
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,545
0,150 150,390 390,585 585,830 1300,1575
map opens the file and

910
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:11,910
0,195 195,405 405,585 585,875 1105,1365
the OS does all the

911
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,095
0,225 225,450 450,570 570,830 880,1185
management of the data, moving

912
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:13,740
0,135 135,255 255,405 405,510 510,645
the data back and forth

913
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,800
0,150 150,410
forth us.|

914
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,020
0,230 230,305 305,380 380,455 455,560
So it sort of look

915
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,605
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,510 510,585
like this. We have an

916
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,385
0,135 135,375 375,570 570,735 735,780
on disk file. We have

917
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,700
0,30 30,105 105,210 210,455
a bunch of pages.|

918
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,570
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,645 645,870
We call m map to

919
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,815
0,135 135,225 225,470 850,1110 1110,1245
open it up and then

920
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:22,535
0,165 165,240 240,360 360,540 540,720
we'll have a concept of

921
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,335
0,195 195,495 495,875 925,1325 1465,1800
virtual memory and and physical

922
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:25,745
0,335 475,750 750,975 975,1245 1245,1410
memory. So virtual memory would

923
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:26,600
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,675 675,855
be what I see in

924
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,170
0,150 150,435 435,735 735,1040 2170,2570
my process address space. Again,

925
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,575
0,290 290,470 470,710 710,995 995,1235
at some starting location, I'll

926
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,895
0,150 150,455 835,1140 1140,1215 1215,1320
get the, I'll get the

927
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:33,200
0,270 270,575
map file.|

928
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,725
0,260 260,520 570,845 845,1040 1040,1265
And then these virtual memory

929
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:35,310
0,135 135,195 195,285 285,480 480,585
has to be backed by

930
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,405
0,210 210,555 555,810 810,930 930,1095
physical pages. So as I

931
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:38,010
0,180 180,345 345,635 1195,1455 1455,1605
touch a page, the OS

932
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,925
0,165 165,300 300,495 495,750 750,915
has to go, then put

933
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:40,080
0,60 60,275 385,765 765,1020 1020,1155
it into some space in

934
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,475
0,180 180,500 760,1005 1005,1185 1185,1395
physical memory, and then update

935
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,645
0,135 135,660 660,915 915,1020 1020,1170
the wiring for the virtual

936
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,000
0,225 225,545
memory table.|

937
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,270
0,400 960,1480 1500,1775 1775,1940 1940,2230
Right, so that my process

938
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,620
0,260 260,380 380,530 530,725 725,1030
wants to touch page one

939
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,160
0,350 350,560 560,665 665,830 830,1040
so we would have a

940
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,825
0,210 210,510 510,890 1150,1470 1470,1665
page fault because the OS

941
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:51,875
0,135 135,395 445,750 750,945 945,1050
would recognize I don't have

942
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:52,900
0,195 195,390 390,510 510,690 690,1025
page one in physical memory.|

943
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,405
0,210 210,270 270,375 375,510 510,765
It'll go out the disk,

944
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:55,155
0,165 165,315 315,435 435,600 600,750
fetch it for me, put

945
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:56,775
0,105 105,365 865,1155 1155,1365 1365,1620
it in, update virtual memory

946
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:57,540
0,195 195,360 360,555 555,675 675,765
to now, point to it,

947
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,150
0,90 90,195 195,470 850,1230 1230,1610
and then my process can

948
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,210
0,260 260,440 440,635 635,800 800,950
touch it or do whatever

949
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,580
0,150 150,285 285,530
wants with it.|

950
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,555
0,290 290,485 485,635 635,710 710,905
Same thing. Now if I

951
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:03,995
0,240 240,450 450,785 1015,1320 1320,1440
want page three, it's not

952
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:04,595
0,135 135,270 270,405 405,495 495,600
in there. I get a

953
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:05,825
0,195 195,515 565,825 825,1005 1005,1230
page fault. The OS blocks

954
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:07,595
0,195 195,485 1225,1470 1470,1575 1575,1770
my process. When I do,

955
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,035
0,195 195,420 420,645 645,905 1195,1440
when I access it, it

956
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:09,725
0,135 135,330 330,450 450,555 555,690
goes fetch to the page

957
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,285
0,120 120,225 225,345 345,845 1285,1560
I need from disk updates,

958
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,060
0,135 135,540 540,845 1225,1500 1500,1775
the wiring and and then

959
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,990
0,260 260,470 470,820 960,1340 1340,1580
then my process can start

960
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,830
0,195 195,405 405,555 555,705 705,840
running again. My thread can

961
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,980
0,120 120,300 300,620
start running again.|

962
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,955
0,260 260,520 870,1115 1115,1220 1220,1295
What happens if I want

963
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,380
0,60 60,210 210,435 435,755
to touch page two?|

964
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,820
0,290 290,520
What's that?|

965
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,695
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,560 560,635
Is to get rid of

966
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,195
0,245 685,945 945,1050 1050,1230 1230,1500
it. But what happens while

967
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,040
0,255 255,375 375,525 525,615 615,845
I'm getting rid of it?|

968
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,650
0,275 275,545 545,1055 1055,1390 1680,1940
My process stalls, right, I

969
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,415
0,105 105,285 285,465 465,615 615,765
go to the OS is

970
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:32,900
0,75 75,180 180,375 375,695 1105,1485
going to block me while

971
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,010
0,255 255,510 510,780 780,960 960,1110
it says, okay, well I

972
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,685
0,180 180,255 255,360 360,480 480,675
don't have any more physical

973
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:35,885
0,335 565,810 810,915 915,1050 1050,1200
memory, let me go out

974
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:36,700
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,555 555,815
and figure out what to

975
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,180
0,320 320,500 500,635 635,785 785,920
page one or three, which

976
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,100
0,180 180,345 345,465 465,630 630,920
one should I throw away?|

977
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,255
0,400 1260,1520 1520,1730 1730,1985 1985,2165
Right, but the OS is

978
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:43,035
0,105 105,195 195,315 315,480 480,780
going to have its own

979
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,735
0,390 390,785 925,1325 2245,2535 2535,2700
internal statistics about how these

980
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,450
0,180 180,330 330,555 555,1115 1315,1715
pages are being accessed, and

981
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,285
0,410 410,485 485,560 560,650 650,815
it's going to make a

982
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,965
0,305 805,1140 1140,1380 1380,1575 1575,1680
decision about what page to

983
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:50,880
0,335
evict.|

984
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,530
0,260 260,365 365,620 620,845 845,1100
But it doesn't know anything

985
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,445
0,195 195,360 360,555 555,720 720,915
about what we're doing inside

986
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:54,540
0,120 120,330 330,695 745,990 990,1095
the database system because it

987
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,755
0,180 180,540 540,795 795,1035 1035,1215
just seeds reads, writes, it

988
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:58,005
0,335 1165,1425 1425,1575 1575,1865 1915,2250
doesn't a course screen, doesn't

989
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,220
0,105 105,240 240,540 540,815 925,1215
know what queries are, doesn't

990
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,880
0,75 75,225 225,285 285,420 420,660
know what's in these data

991
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,150
0,350 1480,1785 1785,1845 1845,1980 1980,2270
pages, what's in these files.

992
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,645
0,245 245,410 410,620 620,770 770,875
So the OS is going

993
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:04,170
0,105 105,225 225,315 315,390 390,525
to try to make a

994
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,010
0,180 180,315 315,420 420,600 600,840
decision on how to swap

995
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,020
0,165 165,440
things out.|

996
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,265
0,260 260,515 515,760 870,1115 1115,1415
And that's just for eviction.

997
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:08,895
0,240 240,300 300,405 405,525 525,630
There's a whole bunch of

998
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:10,695
0,195 195,545 1225,1545 1545,1770 1770,1800
other problems that we're going

999
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:11,670
0,75 75,300 300,555 555,750 750,975
to face if we rely

1000
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,345
0,180 180,315 315,465 465,585 585,675
on the OS to do

1001
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,500
0,120 120,270 270,545
this for us.|

1002
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,660
0,400 660,920 920,1070 1070,1280 1280,1490
So in my first example

1003
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,850
0,225 225,450 450,630 630,855 855,1190
here, I shared one thread

1004
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,825
0,275 275,550 780,1145 1145,1445 1445,1775
or one process with accessing

1005
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:20,560
0,245
it.|

1006
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,310
0,240 240,420 420,630 630,675 675,750
But again, we're going to

1007
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,940
0,105 105,195 195,300 300,405 405,630
try to build a database,

1008
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,260
0,225 225,470 700,1020 1020,1200 1200,1320
a monitoring system that can

1009
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,120
0,165 165,390 390,710 1090,1455 1455,1860
take advantage of multiple cores

1010
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,295
0,120 120,315 315,860 1720,2010 2010,2175
or multiple cpus. And so

1011
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:27,865
0,135 135,210 210,270 270,375 375,570
we need to have multiple

1012
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,260
0,345 345,540 540,815
threads access them.|

1013
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,300
0,260 260,425 425,575 575,710 710,860
But now, what if one

1014
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,280
0,120 120,380
of them?|

1015
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,870
0,75 75,150 150,270 270,360 360,590
You know, one of them

1016
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,635
0,380 380,590 590,845 845,1040 1040,1175
touches something, writes it, and

1017
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:35,535
0,210 210,465 465,630 630,765 765,900
then another guy tries to

1018
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,150
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,450 450,615
read it, but it gets

1019
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,640
0,360 360,450 450,680 880,1140 1140,1490
stalled because it gets evicted.

1020
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,570
0,260 260,605 605,755 755,995 995,1220
The ordering can get kind

1021
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,740
0,165 165,570 570,795 795,975 975,1170
of screwy. And again, the

1022
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,200
0,180 180,345 345,645 645,920 1060,1460
operating system doesn't know anything

1023
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,665
0,335 335,470 470,760 780,1115 1115,1295
that's going on, what's running

1024
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:44,385
0,195 195,315 315,480 480,630 630,720
inside the system at the

1025
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:45,440
0,150 150,455
same time.|

1026
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,190
0,365 365,560 560,650 650,785 785,1060
So everything is read, only

1027
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:48,620
0,135 135,455
it's OK.|

1028
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,800
0,245 245,365 365,455 455,665 665,920
Because we're not dirty any

1029
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,150
0,320 550,825 825,990 990,1155 1155,1350
pages, the OS can swap

1030
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,920
0,165 165,440 1210,1515 1515,1605 1605,1770
things out. It'll be good

1031
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,030
0,290 490,735 735,810 810,915 915,1110
enough. And there are some

1032
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,855
0,270 270,450 450,525 525,645 645,825
cases. There are some data

1033
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,565
0,240 240,480 480,705 705,1025 1405,1710
systems that do use m

1034
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:58,425
0,305 685,975 975,1265 1375,1650 1650,1860
map just for read only

1035
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,880
0,225 225,360 360,480 480,755
parts of the system.|

1036
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,510
0,245 245,350 350,455 455,605 605,770
But if you now need

1037
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,565
0,105 105,255 255,510 510,860 1720,2055
to have multiple writers, which

1038
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:04,420
0,225 225,375 375,480 480,645 645,855
again, in a real system,

1039
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,130
0,165 165,210 210,285 285,420 420,710
we're going to want this.|

1040
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,990
0,230 230,290 290,365 365,470 470,560
Then there's a bunch of

1041
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,260
0,120 120,410
other problems.|

1042
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,085
0,260 260,380 380,545 545,740 740,965
So the first one is

1043
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,165
0,335 385,720 720,915 915,1005 1005,1080
transaction safety. This is the

1044
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:12,130
0,240 240,525 525,645 645,720 720,965
one I sort of mentioned

1045
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,920
0,395 395,695 695,860 860,1120 1470,1870
if I have a transaction

1046
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,080
0,335 335,575 575,845 845,1210
that updates multiple pages.|

1047
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,295
0,195 195,375 375,585 585,900 900,1215
ID to make sure that

1048
00:26:18,295 --> 00:26:19,390
0,270 270,495 495,720 720,915 915,1095
these pages are actually written

1049
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,250
0,195 195,345 345,450 450,585 585,860
out in the right order

1050
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,730
0,260 260,455 455,650 650,890 890,1100
and the OS doesn't know

1051
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,185
0,240 240,435 435,710 970,1260 1260,1455
that because this sees dirty

1052
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,700
0,305 595,840 840,1050 1050,1260 1260,1515
pages it doesn't know anything

1053
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,740
0,290
about.|

1054
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,670
0,260 260,440 440,680 680,845 845,920
Does this page need to

1055
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,405
0,105 105,270 270,450 450,585 585,735
be written before this other

1056
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:28,440
0,305
page?|

1057
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,660
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,755 755,950
You can do some things

1058
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,515
0,195 195,330 330,465 465,660 660,855
like you can lock the

1059
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:33,285
0,195 195,420 420,905 1375,1620 1620,1770
page using mlock, but that

1060
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,320
0,225 225,495 495,675 675,840 840,1035
only prevents the OS from

1061
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,715
0,375 375,465 465,710 910,1245 1245,1395
swapping it out, doesn't prevent

1062
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:37,155
0,150 150,285 285,510 510,845 1195,1440
it from writing out. So

1063
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:37,905
0,150 150,300 300,435 435,600 600,750
now it may write out

1064
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:38,745
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,735 735,840
a dirty page that it

1065
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,020
0,210 210,455 565,900 900,1125 1125,1275
shouldn't have. I crash and

1066
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,860
0,135 135,360 360,570 570,705 705,840
come back, and now I

1067
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,225
0,165 165,470 670,1005 1005,1260 1260,1365
have changes that shouldn't have

1068
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,600
0,150 150,300 300,435 435,695
been written a desk.|

1069
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,320
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,545 545,680
And I had to go

1070
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,460
0,150 150,410 520,780 780,945 945,1140
figure out how to reverse

1071
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,670
0,290 790,1080 1080,1370 1390,1790 1810,2210
that or deal with the

1072
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,320
0,305 305,605 605,1250 1250,1510
bad data, inconsistent data.|

1073
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,115
0,320 320,440 440,605 605,740 740,935
We've already talked about doing

1074
00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:55,470
0,605 1705,1980 1980,2115 2115,2235 2235,2355
stalls. Again, if you try

1075
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,355
0,180 180,360 360,525 525,795 795,885
to access something that's not

1076
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,045
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,600 600,690
in memory, you get a

1077
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:58,290
0,210 210,480 480,750 750,1020 1020,1245
major page fault. It blocks

1078
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,480
0,210 210,420 420,615 615,915 915,1190
your thread, he schedules you,

1079
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,890
0,400 480,845 845,1240 1410,1730 1730,1910
the disk scheduler goes get

1080
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,715
0,135 135,330 330,540 540,675 675,825
your page brings it in,

1081
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:03,525
0,165 165,255 255,405 405,615 615,810
and when it's available, then

1082
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,425
0,90 90,195 195,540 540,750 750,900
you get resched your thread

1083
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,800
0,150 150,600 600,875
gets rescheduled again.|

1084
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,755
0,245 245,365 365,515 515,635 635,785
But now your thread is

1085
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,500
0,225 225,405 405,600 600,935
blocked in doing nothing.|

1086
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,725
0,400 780,1040 1040,1145 1145,1390 1500,1715
Right. And it maybe there

1087
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:11,400
0,45 45,195 195,495 495,585 585,675
are other queries you could

1088
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,025
0,225 225,590 2020,2325 2325,2520 2520,2625
possibly run while you're waiting

1089
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:14,700
0,120 120,225 225,360 360,480 480,675
for that thing to fetch.

1090
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,220
0,180 180,345 345,480 480,950
Get fetch from disk.|

1091
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,255
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,605 605,815
So then you say, okay,

1092
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,550
0,135 135,285 285,495 495,725 895,1295
well, maybe I'll make a

1093
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,940
0,620 620,665 665,755 755,1115 1115,1250
dispatcher or a scheduler so

1094
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,050
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,870 870,1110
that there's only one thread

1095
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,770
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,495 495,720
that goes and gets things

1096
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,580
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,585 585,810
and there's a page fault.

1097
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,360
0,180 180,345 345,570 570,720 720,780
He gets blocked and then

1098
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,305
0,75 75,180 180,300 300,560 700,945
I can run another run

1099
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:25,620
0,75 75,150 150,255 255,725
out of the threads.|

1100
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,570
0,245 245,365 365,515 515,620 620,850
But now you kind of,

1101
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,095
0,320 320,515 515,815 815,1130 1130,1475
you're building more infrastructure around

1102
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:30,920
0,240 240,725 925,1325 1525,2075
the limitations of map.|

1103
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,875
0,305 305,470 470,590 590,710 710,845
Next problem you have is

1104
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:33,780
0,120 120,195 195,255 255,405 405,905
how do you handle errors?|

1105
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,735
0,365 365,730 1530,1820 1820,2110 2130,2435
Right. If I'm map, if

1106
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,040
0,305 355,615 615,825 825,1095 1095,1305
I try to access a

1107
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,515
0,290 850,1250 1870,2160 2160,2310 2310,2475
page that for whatever reason

1108
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:43,720
0,210 210,585 585,690 690,870 870,1205
it's corrupted or not available,

1109
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,000
0,440 440,725 725,965 965,1300
there's some hardware problem.|

1110
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,160
0,245 245,395 395,470 470,650 650,950
You don't get an exception

1111
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,435
0,210 210,345 345,570 570,920 1030,1275
as you would if you

1112
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,155
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,480 480,720
write it in user space

1113
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:50,760
0,305 775,1035 1035,1140 1140,1260 1260,1605
code, you get a sigus

1114
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,120
0,270 270,650
and interrupt.|

1115
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,235
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,605 605,815
Now you need a signal

1116
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:54,540
0,525 525,855 855,1095 1095,1215 1215,1305
handler all throughout the rest

1117
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,725
0,90 90,195 195,470 820,1065 1065,1185
of your system because you

1118
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:56,990
0,165 165,315 315,510 510,845 865,1265
may be doing something that

1119
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,580
0,320 320,500 500,635 635,890 890,1270
is in a critical section

1120
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,820
0,305 305,485 485,710 710,785 785,860
that you don't want to

1121
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,995
0,230 340,765 765,1010 1570,1920 1920,2175
get interrupted or break. So

1122
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:02,415
0,135 135,195 195,270 270,345 345,420
therefore you have to have

1123
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,870
0,195 195,420 420,875 1075,1320 1320,1455
an interrupt handler to make

1124
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,815
0,150 150,345 345,570 570,750 750,945
sure you can go back

1125
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:05,355
0,150 150,255 255,375 375,465 465,540
to the thing you were

1126
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,580
0,105 105,365
doing before.|

1127
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,900
0,320
Ah.|

1128
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,360
0,210 210,560 580,980 1090,1490 2200,2460
To handle this interrupt because

1129
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,000
0,260 280,540 540,645 645,890 2380,2640
this is the only, this

1130
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,310
0,150 150,360 360,630 630,945 945,1310
is how the operating system

1131
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,520
0,335 335,575 575,770 770,905 905,1070
tells you. Things are going

1132
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,050
0,320 910,1170 1170,1350 1350,1425 1425,1530
bad. You can't get back

1133
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,890
0,120 120,285 285,525 525,720 720,840
in error code, you get

1134
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,100
0,255 255,630 630,1010
back and interrupt.|

1135
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,920
0,245 245,365 365,530 530,590 590,680
To say that's a lot

1136
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,500
0,195 195,530 640,1020 1020,1290 1290,1580
of engineering to handle this,

1137
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,140
0,245 245,410 410,470 470,530 530,620
you don't want to do

1138
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,285
0,260 730,990 990,1250 1570,1965 1965,2145
this. And then there's obviously

1139
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:28,100
0,105 105,150 150,270 270,495 495,815
going to be performance issues.

1140
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,245
0,260 260,395 395,590 590,910 1500,1835
And this is because the

1141
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:31,905
0,225 225,390 390,510 510,585 585,660
operating system is going to

1142
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:32,895
0,90 90,225 225,495 495,780 780,990
have its own internal data

1143
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:33,900
0,270 270,525 525,750 750,840 840,1005
structures about what's in memory

1144
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,790
0,150 150,300 300,590 1420,1740 1740,1890
and not memory, what's getting

1145
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,770
0,225 225,375 375,480 480,660 660,980
scheduled or not getting scheduled.

1146
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,025
0,275 275,425 425,575 575,740 740,935
And it has to protect

1147
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:39,420
0,255 255,555 555,905 955,1245 1245,1395
those critical sections inside its

1148
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,820
0,150 150,360 360,680
own data structures.|

1149
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,130
0,260 260,410 410,650 650,905 905,1210
With new taxes or whatever,

1150
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,870
0,400 570,890 890,1205 1205,1265 1265,1310
and now that's going to

1151
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,400
0,60 60,135 135,435 435,770
be a contention point.|

1152
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,065
0,400 450,785 785,1025 1025,1280 1280,1565
Whereas in a database system,

1153
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,115
0,195 195,345 345,570 570,795 795,1050
since we know what queries

1154
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:49,955
0,120 120,255 255,375 375,585 585,840
are trying to do because

1155
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,455
0,225 225,480 480,540 540,1145 1225,1500
again, sql is declarative, we

1156
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:52,370
0,150 150,255 255,345 345,690 690,915
know what the queries want

1157
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,985
0,120 120,285 285,435 435,525 525,615
to do because we have

1158
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,275
0,90 90,300 300,665 925,1185 1185,1290
the physical plan, we know

1159
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,115
0,150 150,375 375,585 585,735 735,840
what the data are trying

1160
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:56,510
0,165 165,485 745,1065 1065,1260 1260,1395
to access and therefore we

1161
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,275
0,165 165,375 375,420 420,510 510,765
can we're in a better

1162
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,625
0,300 300,495 495,785 955,1215 1215,1350
decision to decide how to

1163
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,820
0,195 195,515
schedule things.|

1164
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,240
0,400
Yes.|

1165
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,165
0,275 275,455 455,635 635,785 785,995
His question is the database

1166
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,185
0,255 255,435 435,585 585,825 825,1020
systems have the privilege to

1167
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:09,595
0,90 90,180 180,375 375,725 1165,1410
work with hardware directly. There

1168
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:11,070
0,150 150,420 420,720 720,1005 1005,1475
are methods called kernel bypass

1169
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,080
0,380 380,725 725,1090
where you can.|

1170
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,875
0,165 165,375 375,525 525,705 705,795
Or mv m is sort

1171
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,840
0,75 75,165 165,390 390,690 690,965
of like this. There's ways

1172
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,220
0,245 245,410 410,695 695,905 905,1150
to make calls to hardware

1173
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,835
0,350 350,575 575,850 870,1130 1130,1235
without having to rely on

1174
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:20,100
0,135 135,425
the OS.|

1175
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,530
0,285 285,495 495,675 675,885 885,1110
The problem with those things

1176
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,990
0,285 285,585 585,890 910,1185 1185,1460
are you basically have to

1177
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,915
0,305 305,455 455,560 560,650 650,785
implement a bunch of the

1178
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,265
0,255 255,570 570,915 915,1200 1200,1350
OS back up inside the

1179
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,770
0,195 195,545 1075,1475 1975,2310 2310,2505
database system. So there's something

1180
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,830
0,350 1240,1485 1485,1560 1560,1665 1665,2060
called this is a tangent.

1181
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,905
0,260 260,395 395,635 635,725 725,785
If you don't want to

1182
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,165
0,75 75,195 195,455 565,900 900,1260
have to use the os'

1183
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:34,385
0,450 450,755 985,1245 1245,1745 1915,2220
tcp stack for networking, there's

1184
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:35,940
0,165 165,485
something called.|

1185
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,460
0,400 420,820 1110,1510 2430,2960 2960,3200
Ah, the the DVD k

1186
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,555
0,210 210,555 555,705 705,870 870,1095
from Intel, the data playing

1187
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:41,790
0,225 225,480 480,675 675,885 885,1235
data kit or development kit.

1188
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,940
0,395 395,695 695,770 770,905 905,1040
Basically, it's a way to

1189
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,830
0,195 195,420 420,540 540,630 630,890
hook directly in the hardware

1190
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,220
0,245 245,365 365,545 545,815 815,1220
and you get raw packets

1191
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,570
0,260 520,780 780,915 915,1140 1140,1350
out, but again, it's raw

1192
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,890
0,450 450,600 600,750 750,855 855,1320
packets. If it's a tcp

1193
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,050
0,320 640,930 930,1080 1080,1340 1870,2160
connection, now you gotta keep

1194
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,340
0,180 180,375 375,540 540,1005 1005,1290
track of the tcp headers

1195
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,610
0,260 490,890 2500,2850 2850,3075 3075,3270
and right? Very few database

1196
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,465
0,255 255,450 450,585 585,705 705,855
systems do this. I only

1197
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,500
0,225 225,545
know two.|

1198
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,390
0,225 225,560 580,980 1300,1620 1620,1890
One was, eh, one yellow

1199
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,340
0,350 610,975 975,1215 1215,1490 1660,1950
brick. We discuss them throughout

1200
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,940
0,135 135,300 300,465 465,525 525,600
the professor. They a bunch

1201
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,280
0,225 225,540 540,765 765,990 990,1340
of amazing stuff. They basically

1202
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,740
0,455 455,575 575,820 1590,1895 1895,2200
rewrite their own. They basically

1203
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,950
0,320 320,515 515,665 665,860 860,1100
only use the OS to

1204
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,015
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,680 820,1065
turn the thing on and

1205
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,215
0,165 165,405 405,615 615,975 975,1200
they never call malloc again.

1206
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,120
0,165 165,435 435,555 555,660 660,905
They allocate all the memory,

1207
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,765
0,305 305,610 870,1130 1130,1250 1250,1355
everything beginning. They wrote their

1208
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,300
0,135 135,575 595,975 975,1170 1170,1535
own tc PC I drivers.

1209
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,230
0,245 245,320 320,365 365,440 440,700
They do a bunch of

1210
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,040
0,400 480,880 1110,1400 1400,1595 1595,1760
amazing engineering. Few people do

1211
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,270
0,260 550,780 780,885 885,1050 1050,1230
that. The other was was

1212
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,505
0,300 300,740 850,1250 1540,1800 1800,2235
scalia DB. But the dbdk

1213
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,420
0,165 165,405 405,615 615,720 720,915
was so difficult to handle

1214
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,370
0,350 1030,1395 1395,1650 1650,1830 1830,1950
that was huge pain. They

1215
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,990
0,150 150,225 225,470 550,950 1390,1620
don't do it. So the

1216
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,730
0,105 105,210 210,285 285,435 435,740
answer to the question is.|

1217
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,540
0,290 290,470 470,650 650,815 815,980
For some things, you have

1218
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,310
0,135 135,240 240,360 360,495 495,770
to go through the OS.|

1219
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,605
0,260 260,395 395,845 845,1025 1025,1145
In the eighties they got

1220
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,320
0,210 210,545 595,870 870,1145 1315,1715
really crazy and like they,

1221
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,875
0,230 230,305 305,425 425,560 560,755
instead of using a file

1222
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,930
0,285 285,510 510,675 675,810 810,1055
system, they wrote their own

1223
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,170
0,335 335,560 560,710 710,830 830,1040
storage layer on top of

1224
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,195
0,315 315,630 630,980 1210,1610 1750,2025
raw block devices. Like people

1225
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:40,100
0,150 150,315 315,450 450,600 600,905
have tried this every years

1226
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,040
0,260 260,485 485,815 815,1180
from an engineering perspective.|

1227
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,495
0,335 335,710 710,1000 1050,1295 1295,1385
It's oftentimes you do have

1228
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:45,215
0,105 105,225 225,330 330,480 480,720
to rely on the OS,

1229
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:46,190
0,180 180,255 255,330 330,465 465,975
but you want to minimize

1230
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,640
0,240 240,450 450,675 675,950
your contact with it.|

1231
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,270
0,105 105,195 195,345 345,525 525,630
Because the OS is going

1232
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,480
0,45 45,90 90,180 180,440
to be your enemy.|

1233
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,920
0,275 275,550
Other questions?|

1234
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,310
0,230 230,365 365,470 470,560 560,650
I don't spend too much

1235
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,050
0,120 120,210 210,560 1150,1545 1545,1740
time on mf suffice say

1236
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,145
0,180 180,255 255,450 450,765 765,1095
it's a bad idea, don't

1237
00:30:58,145 --> 00:31:00,310
0,105 105,365 1495,1740 1740,1875 1875,2165
do it. If I die,

1238
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,850
0,245 245,455 455,650 650,740 740,830
you know you can put

1239
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,245
0,60 60,180 180,680 940,1230 1230,1395
on my tombstone never use

1240
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:05,530
0,225 225,315 315,390 390,635 1885,2285
mf for your database. And

1241
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,890
0,260 260,425 425,635 635,830 830,1100
the reason why I I

1242
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,550
0,240 240,345 345,420 420,525 525,660
was want to bring this

1243
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,945
0,135 135,330 330,650 1090,1320 1320,1395
up is because, you know

1244
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:09,620
0,165 165,360 360,480 480,585 585,675
we invite a lot of

1245
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,000
0,230 310,660 660,930 930,1125 1125,1380
these database companies and startups

1246
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,645
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,495 495,645
to come give talks at

1247
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:13,535
0,105 105,210 210,485 715,1115 1315,1890
C M U and surprisingly

1248
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:14,075
0,135 135,225 225,330 330,450 450,540
over the last couple of

1249
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:14,900
0,195 195,420 420,585 585,690 690,825
years a lot of them

1250
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,490
0,240 240,465 465,585 585,1070 1330,1590
mentioned they're using map and

1251
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,510
0,105 105,240 240,420 420,710 760,1020
we ask them why and

1252
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,485
0,135 135,300 300,495 495,660 660,975
they say oh because it's

1253
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,360
0,225 225,315 315,465 465,630 630,875
quick and easy to use

1254
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,450
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,635 635,770
and then when we go

1255
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,035
0,180 180,300 300,375 375,480 480,585
talk to them a few

1256
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:21,710
0,120 120,300 300,450 450,555 555,675
years later like oh yeah,

1257
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,415
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,480 480,705
that was a huge mistake.

1258
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:22,970
0,135 135,240 240,345 345,450 450,555
We should not have done

1259
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,870
0,315 315,495 495,585 585,690 690,900
map. We should have done

1260
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,115
0,330 330,690 690,975 975,1140 1140,1245
what lecture six is going

1261
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,915
0,90 90,210 210,485 625,1025 1555,1800
to teach you, right? So

1262
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:27,815
0,180 180,255 255,555 555,720 720,900
here's a listing of some

1263
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:28,685
0,195 195,360 360,480 480,660 660,870
systems that I know using

1264
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,530
0,255 255,390 390,435 435,555 555,845
map. There's a couple others

1265
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,650
0,335 335,500 500,725 725,860 860,1070
I'm sure I'm missing. There's

1266
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,300
0,60 60,135 135,210 210,405 405,650
a bunch of hobby projects.|

1267
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,340
0,210 210,345 345,495 495,615 615,720
So the one at the

1268
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,165
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,570 570,825
top, these are full users.

1269
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:35,250
0,225 225,360 360,600 600,825 825,1085
These are systems where they

1270
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,170
0,350 350,605 605,935 935,1100 1100,1360
entirely use map for all

1271
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,755
0,260 260,520 660,935 935,1070 1070,1265
of data back and forth

1272
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:41,300
0,225 225,465 465,555 555,815
from disk and memory.|

1273
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,110
0,210 210,375 375,600 600,750 750,810
The most famous one of

1274
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,285
0,105 105,255 255,405 405,800 1900,2175
these is probably elastic Mo.

1275
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,710
0,180 180,390 390,555 555,815 925,1425
Eighty b was a commore

1276
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,200
0,105 105,350
out of.|

1277
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,640
0,400
Right.|

1278
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,005
0,245 245,380 380,590 590,755 755,875
C W I the same

1279
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,670
0,135 135,255 255,465 465,935 1435,1665
place that build DB the

1280
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,250
0,525 525,750 750,1050 1050,1290 1290,1580
lmdb do probably the exact

1281
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,280
0,245 245,350 350,560 560,770 770,980
opposite of me where I'm

1282
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,390
0,180 180,405 405,585 585,885 885,1110
saying never use map. He's

1283
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,790
0,225 225,620 640,900 900,1020 1020,1400
like always always use map

1284
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,030
0,305 305,500 500,635 635,935 935,1010
and he been banned on

1285
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,095
0,75 75,180 180,360 360,585 585,1065
a bunch of different databases

1286
00:31:59,095 --> 00:31:59,965
0,270 270,435 435,585 585,690 690,870
mailing list because he would

1287
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:00,790
0,210 210,375 375,510 510,645 645,825
email them and say like

1288
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,500
0,165 165,300 300,390 390,465 465,710
you guys should be using,

1289
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,380
0,230 230,305 305,380 380,515 515,680
you should be using L

1290
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,240
0,135 135,255 255,420 420,600 600,860
M D B should using

1291
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,010
0,260 260,520 540,940 990,1325 1325,1570
m map, right? He's wrong.|

1292
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,095
0,400 2790,3065 3065,3245 3245,3290 3290,3395
He but here's the ones

1293
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,500
0,275 1285,1650 1650,1965 1965,2315 3175,3405
the partially using it. Actually,

1294
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,400
0,120 120,300 300,630 630,735 735,900
I put manga as full

1295
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,135
0,225 225,420 420,525 525,645 645,735
user. They should really be

1296
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,335
0,60 60,165 165,425 745,1050 1050,1200
at the top, but the

1297
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,120
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,450 450,785
ones at the bottom here,

1298
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,165
0,275 275,425 425,575 575,695 695,785
they all got rid of

1299
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:18,860
0,245
it.|

1300
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,110
0,395 395,680 680,830 830,1010 1010,1160
Right, because of all the

1301
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,090
0,230 250,495 495,570 570,690 690,980
issues that I mentioned before,

1302
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,345
0,245 245,350 350,610 690,935 935,1055
you can get, you can

1303
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,190
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,585 585,845
get something up and running

1304
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,415
0,290 290,580 630,875 875,950 950,1055
pretty quickly if you use

1305
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,285
0,300 300,555 555,720 720,840 840,870
map, because you don't have

1306
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:25,855
0,60 60,180 180,285 285,360 360,570
to build your own buffer

1307
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:27,535
0,90 90,335 835,1200 1200,1455 1455,1680
pool manager, but because you're

1308
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:28,465
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,660 660,930
lying on the OS to

1309
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,370
0,225 225,405 405,540 540,645 645,905
move data back and forth,

1310
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,325
0,335 335,410 410,470 470,575 575,815
it's going to make horrible

1311
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,380
0,365 955,1355
decisions, right?|

1312
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,745
0,395 395,530 530,820 990,1220 1220,1325
I'm not going, I don't

1313
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,390
0,30 30,90 90,180 180,300 300,645
want to pick a mongo

1314
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,095
0,135 135,405 405,450 450,525 525,705
but mongo is the best

1315
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,625
0,240 240,390 390,600 600,1175 1225,1530
example of this. Mongo started

1316
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:37,375
0,180 180,285 285,375 375,510 510,750
off with an m map

1317
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,060
0,365 475,780 780,1080 1080,1380 1380,1685
based storage engine storage manager

1318
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,675
0,275 275,550 630,890 890,995 995,1085
and they, they were the

1319
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:41,635
0,135 135,375 375,570 570,660 660,960
hot database in the 2000

1320
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:43,150
0,335 595,885 885,1065 1065,1290 1290,1515
tens. They raised a ton

1321
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,250
0,180 180,300 300,495 495,780 780,1100
of, you know, investor money

1322
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,565
0,245 245,320 320,440 440,650 650,935
and they had really good

1323
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:46,990
0,285 285,450 450,695 1075,1320 1320,1425
engineers, so they and they

1324
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,605
0,120 120,240 240,375 375,510 510,615
were based on time and

1325
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,060
0,365 565,855 855,1185 1185,1335 1335,1455
map if map was the

1326
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,360
0,195 195,530
right choice.|

1327
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,070
0,305 305,530 530,680 680,910 1320,1610
Then they could have, they

1328
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,840
0,120 120,195 195,315 315,480 480,770
could have made that work.|

1329
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,570
0,305 305,455 455,545 545,680 680,970
But what do they do?

1330
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,570
0,305 305,455 455,545 545,710 710,950
They threw it all away

1331
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,485
0,165 165,270 270,420 420,645 645,915
and they bought wire tiger

1332
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:57,520
0,180 180,390 390,645 645,855 855,1035
with a storage manager that

1333
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,900
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,710
doesn't use that map.|

1334
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,495
0,400 1260,1625 1625,1865 1865,2140 2220,2465
Right. So again, just to

1335
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:03,220
0,425 535,870 870,1185 1185,1500 1500,1725
reiterate, never use, we don't

1336
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,210
0,60 60,290 370,645 645,780 780,990
want to use the OS

1337
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,695
0,195 195,345 345,650 910,1260 1260,1485
to manage memory because the

1338
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:06,565
0,195 195,375 375,585 585,795 795,870
data system is always going

1339
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:07,330
0,45 45,180 180,330 330,510 510,765
to be a better position

1340
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,460
0,165 165,270 270,530
to do this.|

1341
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,300
0,180 180,405 405,585 585,735 735,840
And it's not just for

1342
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,710
0,210 210,480 480,780 780,1065 1065,1410
managing memory, it's basically for

1343
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,850
0,350 460,705 705,900 900,1035 1035,1140
everything. We don't need the

1344
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,825
0,165 165,375 375,735 735,855 855,975
us for scheduling, we don't

1345
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,745
0,30 30,245 565,945 945,1325 1375,1920
want to us for caching

1346
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,670
0,335 1195,1425 1425,1590 1590,1695 1695,1925
rights, we don't the us

1347
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,500
0,290 290,580 630,1030
use the for.|

1348
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,735
0,260 260,365 365,545 545,755 755,995
And the network stuff you

1349
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,605
0,255 255,435 435,585 585,705 705,870
need to in some cases,

1350
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,165
0,305 865,1215 1215,1380 1380,1470 1470,1560
but there's tricks for that,

1351
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,740
0,245 625,960 960,1170 1170,1380 1380,1575
but the OS is always

1352
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,240
0,90 90,135 135,180 180,255 255,500
going to be a problem.|

1353
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,725
0,380 1030,1320 1320,1560 1560,1910 2410,2685
Ah, and again for m

1354
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:29,775
0,240 240,555 555,840 840,930 930,1050
map. Again, I'll send this

1355
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,020
0,135 135,300 300,845 895,1140 1140,1245
link on piazza. We wrote

1356
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,575
0,105 105,225 225,360 360,465 465,555
a paper about this, so

1357
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:32,010
0,105 105,195 195,300 300,345 345,435
why you don't want to

1358
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,900
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,585 585,890
use this? And then there's

1359
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,975
0,275 275,365 365,500 500,635 635,845
there's a ten minute Youtube

1360
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,955
0,270 270,720 720,1055 1585,1860 1860,1980
video cartoon about all the

1361
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,480
0,245
problems.|

1362
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,245
0,245 245,425 425,695 695,1030 1050,1325
So again, the OS is

1363
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:40,010
0,120 120,210 210,375 375,570 570,765
going to be a problem

1364
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,655
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,570 570,645
for us, and we have

1365
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:41,750
0,135 135,315 315,465 465,725 835,1095
to design our system to

1366
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,980
0,135 135,240 240,470
deal with it.|

1367
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,505
0,260 260,455 455,785 785,1025 1025,1205
All right, so for database

1368
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,140
0,335 1080,1230 1230,1380 1380,1530 1530,1635
storage, there's two problems I

1369
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,500
0,60 60,135 135,240 240,500
got to deal with.|

1370
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,620
0,245 245,305 305,365 365,425 425,560
How are we going to

1371
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,705
0,320 820,1220 1480,1725 1725,1905 1905,2085
represent the the database on

1372
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:54,220
0,135 135,330 330,510 510,995 1255,1515
these files on disk? And

1373
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,770
0,260 670,945 945,1080 1080,1245 1245,1550
then once we have those,

1374
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,905
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,710 710,965
how do we move data

1375
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,030
0,210 210,345 345,495 495,675 675,1125
back and forth from disk

1376
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,295
0,300 300,620 1270,1650 1650,2100 2100,2265
into memory? So today's lecture

1377
00:34:00,295 --> 00:34:01,120
0,300 300,495 495,555 555,675 675,825
is going to be on

1378
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,620
0,225 225,495 495,705 705,1010 1240,1500
the first problem here, and

1379
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,900
0,105 105,255 255,435 435,770 1960,2280
then we'll cover the second

1380
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
0,320 850,1125 1125,1320 1320,1545 1545,2000
problem in the upcoming lectures.|

1381
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,180
0,400
Right.|

1382
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,305
0,400 630,950 950,995 995,1025 1025,1115
So there's going to be

1383
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,720
0,120 120,300 300,600 600,1110 1110,1415
sort of three layers of

1384
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,945
0,290 290,470 470,605 605,680 680,785
what data is going to

1385
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:15,980
0,150 150,390 390,615 615,750 750,1035
look like on these disk

1386
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,665
0,290 2050,2265 2265,2340 2340,2490 2490,2685
pages. So the first question

1387
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,170
0,305 655,915 915,1005 1005,1170 1170,1505
is, what do these files

1388
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,620
0,260 260,410 410,700
actually look like?|

1389
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,170
0,255 255,530 700,1035 1035,1260 1260,1550
And then within a file,

1390
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,335
0,305 305,455 455,760 810,1040 1040,1145
there's be pages, because we

1391
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:26,210
0,195 195,405 405,495 495,600 600,875
to break it up into

1392
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,245
0,320 320,820 960,1205 1205,1450 1590,1835
different chunks. And then then

1393
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:29,130
0,180 180,330 330,465 465,630 630,885
we'll discuss what these pages

1394
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,675
0,225 225,500 970,1230 1230,1350 1350,1545
look like. And then within

1395
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:31,530
0,255 255,525 525,750 750,795 795,855
that page, we're going to

1396
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,230
0,135 135,590 760,1035 1035,1305 1305,1700
have twoples the data itself,

1397
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,655
0,275 275,550 1530,1775 1775,1925 1925,2165
the tables. We can ignore

1398
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,110
0,345 345,450 450,695 1135,1380 1380,1455
indexes for now, and you

1399
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,805
0,60 60,180 180,405 405,740 1420,1695
have to decide what actually

1400
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:40,190
0,120 120,240 240,375 375,635 985,1385
two pol look like. So

1401
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,070
0,275 275,380 380,485 485,695 695,860
start at the top and

1402
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,350
0,165 165,405 405,630 630,915 915,1280
then go deeper, deeper inside

1403
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,490
0,400 510,785 785,1060 1260,1580 1580,1760
of these files to understand

1404
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,040
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,770 1150,1550
what, what they actually contain.|

1405
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,545
0,230 230,305 305,410 410,530 530,755
So as I said before,

1406
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,490
0,210 210,405 405,675 675,855 855,945
the database system is going

1407
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,915
0,60 60,290 490,765 765,1040 1090,1425
to maintain a database as

1408
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:52,635
0,165 165,240 240,360 360,540 540,720
one or more files on

1409
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,270
0,485 625,1005 1005,1155 1155,1335 1335,1635
disk, sql, light d, DB,

1410
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,290
0,195 195,315 315,480 480,750 750,1020
those are all single file

1411
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,720
0,680 970,1335 1335,1650 1650,1920 1920,2430
databases, all the enterprise databases

1412
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,815
0,165 165,540 540,675 675,930 930,1095
or postgres, my sql, every

1413
00:34:58,815 --> 00:35:00,405
0,285 285,665 1045,1275 1275,1395 1395,1590
other system, you know, more

1414
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,160
0,180 180,390 390,725 1225,1575 1575,1755
full featured system is going

1415
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,890
0,60 60,290 520,920 1240,1485 1485,1730
to be running, you know,

1416
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,835
0,400 420,770 770,1115 1115,1445 1445,1655
maintaining multiple files for your

1417
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,180
0,195 195,360 360,905
tables and databases.|

1418
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,180
0,290 290,560 560,940
And so the.|

1419
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,025
0,400 540,935 935,1295 1295,1595 1595,1835
The format that these files

1420
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:12,895
0,285 285,480 480,525 525,660 660,870
are going to be based

1421
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:14,380
0,210 210,515 835,1215 1215,1425 1425,1485
on is typically going to

1422
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,270
0,60 60,740 910,1230 1230,1550 1570,1890
be proprietary or custom to

1423
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,305
0,225 225,375 375,555 555,840 840,1035
whatever the database system actually

1424
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:18,220
0,245
is.|

1425
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,755
0,320 320,500 500,680 680,890 890,1085
Right, that meaning like you

1426
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,450
0,360 360,615 615,825 825,1320 1320,1695
can't take the postgres database

1427
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,995
0,380 760,1110 1110,1290 1290,1380 1380,1545
files and open them up

1428
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,660
0,285 285,540 540,705 705,1145 1345,1665
in in my sql or

1429
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,380
0,150 150,225 225,330 330,465 465,720
open them up in sql

1430
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,120
0,260 520,795 795,1020 1020,1460 1480,1740
light. Now duct DB because

1431
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,945
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,450 450,825
they want to be portable

1432
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,805
0,180 180,705 705,995 1345,1620 1620,1860
and compatible with with sql

1433
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,170
0,225 225,450 450,690 690,1140 1140,1365
lite. They have connectors allow

1434
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,130
0,195 195,390 390,630 630,825 825,960
you to read, you know,

1435
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,320
0,360 360,585 585,750 750,885 885,1190
sqlite files and other things.

1436
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,115
0,230 230,350 350,640 660,1040 1040,1355
But in general, all the

1437
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:35,940
0,240 240,450 450,630 630,750 750,825
major database systems are going

1438
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,945
0,60 60,180 180,315 315,465 465,1005
to have their own proprietary

1439
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:37,780
0,305
format.|

1440
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,095
0,260 260,440 440,620 620,830 830,1025
And the OS doesn't know

1441
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,965
0,225 225,345 345,615 615,765 765,870
anything about what's inside of

1442
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,405
0,120 120,395 775,1110 1110,1215 1215,1440
these files, doesn't know what's

1443
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,170
0,120 120,195 195,285 285,480 480,765
inside of a page, doesn't

1444
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,205
0,135 135,345 345,675 675,810 810,1035
know where indexes are versus

1445
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,000
0,240 240,420 420,540 540,645 645,795
tables are. It just knows

1446
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,660
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,585 585,660
nothing just sees a bunch

1447
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,760
0,120 120,380
of files.|

1448
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,400
0,275 275,470 470,725 725,950 950,1070
So next class we'll talk

1449
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,110
0,180 180,465 465,690 690,1160 1420,1710
about portal file formats. Things

1450
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,380
0,180 180,705 705,1320 1320,1850 1870,2270
like parquet, aro, orc, arrow.

1451
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,610
0,290 290,410 410,485 485,575 575,820
These are going to be

1452
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,740
0,290 290,580 990,1660 1710,2105 2105,2360
open source specifications for what

1453
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,195
0,260 490,825 825,1095 1095,1305 1305,1455
a database file could look

1454
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:58,440
0,275 715,990 990,1095 1095,1200 1200,1245
like. And then there's a

1455
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,115
0,90 90,180 180,240 240,405 405,675
bunch of ad identity systems

1456
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,180
0,210 210,375 375,585 585,855 855,1065
that know how to to

1457
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,065
0,135 135,255 255,420 420,630 630,885
read them and access them

1458
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,140
0,225 225,375 375,665
and write them.|

1459
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,930
0,215 215,335 335,485 485,605 605,880
But we'll about those later.|

1460
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,830
0,245 245,350 350,485 485,620 620,880
And as I said before,

1461
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,820
0,275 275,395 395,575 575,1090 1320,1580
in the nineteen eighties there

1462
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,200
0,120 120,330 330,525 525,770 1090,1380
was a sort of a

1463
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,115
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,615 615,915
lot of the earlier database

1464
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:11,830
0,335 655,960 960,1125 1125,1350 1350,1715
systems decided that they they

1465
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,325
0,275 275,500 500,710 710,815 815,935
not only were they gonna

1466
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:15,470
0,195 195,645 645,870 870,1265 1885,2145
have customized file formats, they

1467
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,415
0,165 165,315 315,405 405,540 540,945
were also gonna have customized

1468
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,140
0,270 270,605 1135,1380 1380,1515 1515,1725
file systems and they weren't

1469
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,265
0,75 75,165 165,410 760,990 990,1125
going to use E X

1470
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:20,860
0,210 210,515 595,1005 1005,1305 1305,1595
T, three didn't, didn't exist.

1471
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,010
0,245 245,485 485,770 770,905 905,1130
You know, b, three fs

1472
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,955
0,225 225,360 360,495 495,735 735,945
didn't exist back then, but

1473
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:23,930
0,195 195,435 435,600 600,795 795,975
they, whatever the equipment was

1474
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,995
0,105 105,180 180,560 640,900 900,1065
in the eighties, they didn't

1475
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:25,670
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,525 525,675
even rely on what the

1476
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,885
0,290 340,675 675,900 900,1050 1050,1215
OS said, what the file

1477
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,355
0,210 210,515 955,1215 1215,1350 1350,1470
system was. They wanted to

1478
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,720
0,180 180,480 480,845
do everything themselves.|

1479
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
0,245 245,410 410,485 485,590 590,800
But that's a lot of

1480
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,015
0,350 400,735 735,1005 1005,1230 1230,1455
engineering work and, and nobody

1481
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,230
0,210 210,375 375,600 600,885 885,1215
does that today. And it

1482
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,125
0,380 490,765 765,1140 1140,1400 2650,2895
usually a marginal benefit. The

1483
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,070
0,165 165,405 405,630 630,810 810,945
only system that still do

1484
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,970
0,135 135,255 255,405 405,690 690,900
this would be like what

1485
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,395
0,120 120,315 315,570 570,860 1180,1425
I'll call enterprise systems. So

1486
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:40,115
0,75 75,135 135,210 210,315 315,720
this will be an Oracle,

1487
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,100
0,150 150,405 405,695 865,1245 1245,1985
the DB two, the teradatas.

1488
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,625
0,245 245,455 455,755 755,1010 1010,1265
These are million Dollar database

1489
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,360
0,285 285,465 465,555 555,660 660,735
systems that are trying to

1490
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,770
0,90 90,210 210,470 850,1185 1185,1410
get as much, much performance

1491
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,990
0,150 150,270 270,530 1660,1950 1950,2220
as you can. These systems

1492
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,520
0,330 330,555 555,830 1000,1320 1320,1530
will support this in addition

1493
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,395
0,135 135,270 270,560 1090,1410 1410,1875
to running off the generic

1494
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:53,160
0,305 535,825 825,1115
OS file systems.|

1495
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,725
0,260 260,380 380,640 1500,1805 1805,1985
So then the, the part

1496
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:00,715
0,105 105,195 195,375 375,660 660,990
of the database system that's

1497
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:01,690
0,75 75,135 135,285 285,605 715,975
going to be responsible for

1498
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,625
0,260 520,810 810,1250 1480,1740 1740,1935
maintaining and coordinating these different

1499
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,605
0,335 535,870 870,1115 1285,1860 1860,1980
files, we'll call generically as

1500
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:06,900
0,165 165,360 360,665
the storage manager.|

1501
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:08,765
0,135 135,210 210,330 330,465 465,630
Sometimes it's called the storage

1502
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:10,840
0,305 1410,1470 1470,1590 1590,1770 1770,2075
engine. It's the same idea.|

1503
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,110
0,400 840,1235 1235,1295 1295,1340 1340,1460
And it's going to be

1504
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,060
0,135 135,225 225,345 345,585 585,950
part of the system that

1505
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,560
0,695 695,1090 1620,1970 1970,2210 2210,2360
communicates with the either the

1506
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,005
0,260 850,1250 1720,2160 2160,2325 2325,2445
hardware or communicates with the

1507
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,580
0,245 775,1080 1080,1245 1245,1380 1380,1575
hardware or whatever the storage

1508
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,645
0,210 210,435 435,690 690,870 870,1065
device is, either through the

1509
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,475
0,315 315,585 585,875 1075,1455 1455,1830
OS or using direct direct

1510
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:26,790
0,395 985,1385 2275,2865 2865,3075 3075,3315
access to retrieve data and

1511
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,030
0,165 165,285 285,530 1390,1790 1840,2240
bring it into the database

1512
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,880
0,335 335,725 725,970
database system's memory.|

1513
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,335
0,260 260,380 380,575 575,725 725,905
And so we'll discuss this

1514
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,325
0,210 210,480 480,690 690,825 825,990
next class. I keep saying

1515
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:34,315
0,150 150,240 240,840 840,900 900,990
this, but there's so many

1516
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:36,520
0,105 105,270 270,575 1765,2040 2040,2205
things to discuss. A bunch

1517
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,470
0,135 135,270 270,495 495,690 690,950
of these systems will maintain

1518
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,790
0,275 275,550 1410,1805 1805,2120 2120,2210
their own disk scheduler or

1519
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,370
0,620 850,1155 1155,1610 1780,2180 2290,2580
dispatcher that decides when what

1520
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,210
0,210 210,390 390,540 540,690 690,840
pages to read and what

1521
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,025
0,290 1090,1350 1350,1530 1530,1725 1725,1815
order coz. Otherwise, if you

1522
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:45,805
0,90 90,335 355,615 615,720 720,780
just go do more of

1523
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,435
0,135 135,330 330,435 435,525 525,630
f read and gonna say

1524
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,290
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,615 615,765
OS, the OS is gonna

1525
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,995
0,180 180,345 345,465 465,555 555,705
figure out how to order

1526
00:37:47,995 --> 00:37:49,525
0,305 625,915 915,1095 1095,1305 1305,1530
things. But again, the, the,

1527
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,260
0,165 165,345 345,525 525,645 645,735
the Davis system is in

1528
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,025
0,60 60,210 210,450 450,630 630,765
a better position to know

1529
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:52,750
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,725 1465,1725
what it actually needs and

1530
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,580
0,120 120,255 255,530
in what order.|

1531
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,230
0,335 335,605 605,875 875,1190 1190,1520
Various systems can can, can

1532
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,460
0,255 255,420 420,660 660,990 990,1230
have their own thread decide

1533
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,285
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,615 615,825
how to schedule their own

1534
00:37:58,285 --> 00:37:59,560
0,300 300,695
disk reads.|

1535
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,220
0,260 260,365 365,440 440,515 515,620
And you want to do

1536
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,260
0,180 180,465 465,675 675,780 780,1040
this because you want to

1537
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,770
0,560 560,755 755,845 845,980 980,1370
minimize the amount of thrashing,

1538
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,520
0,165 165,390 390,585 585,690 690,750
of bringing things into a

1539
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,180
0,135 135,285 285,390 390,495 495,660
memory, how to throw it,

1540
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,010
0,165 165,255 255,360 360,525 525,830
throw it out right away.

1541
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,130
0,230 230,290 290,380 380,590 590,830
So if you know two

1542
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,170
0,300 300,420 420,540 540,720 720,1040
queries need the same page,

1543
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,545
0,290 290,440 440,575 575,725 725,905
maybe you bring that in

1544
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:10,050
0,305 625,930 930,1080 1080,1215 1215,1505
first before some other pages

1545
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,410
0,260 260,380 380,530 530,695 695,830
and then you you throw

1546
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,655
0,135 135,410 520,825 825,1050 1050,1245
away the first page once

1547
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:13,540
0,120 120,255 255,435 435,630 630,885
you know those two queries

1548
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
0,75 75,180 180,285 285,530
are done with it.|

1549
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,940
0,245 245,350 350,575 575,890 890,1070
So the database files are

1550
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,435
0,45 45,75 75,150 150,315 315,495
going to be broken up

1551
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:18,610
0,275 355,600 600,705 705,870 870,1175
into what I call pages.|

1552
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,125
0,290 370,690 690,945 945,1230 1230,1545
And the data system is

1553
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,290
0,420 420,645 645,870 870,1175 1765,2165
responseor, keeping track of what

1554
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,485
0,305 305,470 470,620 620,845 845,1085
data has been read and

1555
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,110
0,305 535,885 885,1110 1110,1305 1305,1625
written to these various pages,

1556
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,625
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,770 770,935
and then keeps track of

1557
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,480
0,135 135,300 300,480 480,645 645,855
how much space is available

1558
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
0,150 150,240 240,345 345,590
in each of them.|

1559
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,720
0,290 290,440 440,545 545,710 710,890
Because again, if I, if

1560
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,635
0,180 180,570 570,675 675,795 795,915
I insert a new, I

1561
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:33,660
0,90 90,165 165,375 375,450 450,1025
need to insert a newuil,

1562
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,675
0,245 245,350 350,485 485,650 650,815
I need to find a

1563
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:35,455
0,165 165,300 300,435 435,630 630,780
page that has space for

1564
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:36,670
0,245 505,735 735,885 885,1020 1020,1215
me. So I'll keep track

1565
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,840
0,195 195,435 435,795 795,930 930,1170
of some directory that says

1566
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,695
0,255 255,450 450,600 600,735 735,855
this page has this amount

1567
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:39,535
0,105 105,360 360,615 615,735 735,840
of space and go put

1568
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:40,520
0,90 90,195 195,455
it in there.|

1569
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,100
0,275 275,395 395,575 575,910 1110,1510
Now, the data system itself,

1570
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,375
0,290 290,485 485,755 755,1120 1380,1655
the storage manager layer, the

1571
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,160
0,120 120,255 255,360 360,510 510,785
part we're talking about here,

1572
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,420
0,395 395,590 590,740 740,800 800,1030
it's not going to maintain

1573
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,910
0,380 380,950 950,1300 1770,2075 2075,2380
multiple copies of these pages

1574
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,455
0,260 260,725 725,1160 1160,1480 2010,2345
for redundancy replication purposes. We

1575
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,295
0,225 225,450 450,525 525,600 600,840
assume that's going to happen

1576
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:54,680
0,315 315,600 600,915 915,1125 1125,1385
either both above and below

1577
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,520
0,290 290,440 440,530 530,635 635,890
this part of the system

1578
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,185
0,225 225,375 375,680 1150,1455 1455,1665
in the stack. So above

1579
00:38:58,185 --> 00:39:00,645
0,180 180,345 345,635 685,1085 2155,2460
would be like something, something

1580
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:01,845
0,180 180,455 565,825 825,975 975,1200
that knows if a query

1581
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:02,400
0,195 195,345 345,435 435,495 495,555
shows up and wants to

1582
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,390
0,60 60,150 150,410 640,885 885,990
do a write, send it

1583
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,740
0,135 135,410 460,765 765,1035 1035,1350
to another, another physical box

1584
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,000
0,195 195,375 375,870 870,1110 1110,1260
or another node and have

1585
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,035
0,195 195,465 465,750 750,930 930,1035
both those machines do the

1586
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:07,800
0,245
right.|

1587
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,565
0,180 180,300 300,495 495,675 675,765
And then below it would

1588
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:09,360
0,150 150,345 345,480 480,630 630,795
be like, if you're running

1589
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,245
0,345 345,555 555,690 690,780 780,885
raid or some kind of

1590
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:11,205
0,165 165,585 585,690 690,825 825,960
storage appliance that knows how

1591
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:13,170
0,245 475,1005 1005,1295 1585,1830 1830,1965
to replicate pages, and then

1592
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,250
0,195 195,480 480,855 855,975 975,1080
down below, it'll do that

1593
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,240
0,135 135,410
as well.|

1594
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,755
0,395 395,790 840,1160 1160,1340 1340,1505
Typically, database systems will not

1595
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,390
0,285 285,585 585,960 960,1290 1290,1635
maintain multiple copies themselves because

1596
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,035
0,270 270,315 315,405 405,495 495,645
it's a bunch of extra

1597
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:20,000
0,335
work.|

1598
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,920
0,400 450,1055 1055,1205 1205,1370 1370,1430
That ideally, you don't want

1599
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
0,60 60,150 150,255 255,500
to have to do.|

1600
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,060
0,230 230,305 305,395 395,500 500,760
So, what is a page?

1601
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,735
0,230 230,305 305,500 500,850 900,1145
So in our view, from

1602
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:28,785
0,90 90,330 330,645 645,855 855,1050
a data perspective, a page

1603
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,250
0,165 165,240 240,270 270,330 330,465
is going to be a

1604
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,590
0,210 210,530 610,900 900,1065 1065,1340
fixed size block of data

1605
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,540
0,350 350,575 575,785 785,1115 1115,1460
and it can contain data

1606
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,830
0,350 520,870 870,1095 1095,1200 1200,1290
from any part of the

1607
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,305
0,260 340,740 1150,1550 1840,2235 2235,2475
database itself. And for, for

1608
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:38,160
0,135 135,345 345,555 555,705 705,855
this lecture, we assume it's

1609
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,990
0,210 210,615 615,765 765,1040 1600,1830
just twoples or records, but

1610
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,750
0,90 90,225 225,495 495,1100 1360,1760
it can contain indexes, log

1611
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,060
0,400 600,950 950,1550 1550,1715 1715,2260
information, additional metadata, the catalog

1612
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,700
0,400 900,1300 1350,1625 1625,1865 1865,2110
statistics, right? It doesn't matter,

1613
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,150
0,230 230,350 350,440 440,515 515,560
but it's still going to

1614
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,190
0,75 75,210 210,360 360,620 640,1040
be broken up into these.|

1615
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,800
0,315 315,525 525,720 720,1040
These fixed size blocks.|

1616
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,280
0,350 350,620 620,815 815,995 995,1130
Most systems are not going

1617
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,980
0,90 90,285 285,540 540,860 1300,1700
to mix page types, meaning

1618
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,415
0,245 245,425 425,670 930,1190 1190,1325
you don't take a one

1619
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:57,620
0,420 420,615 615,810 810,945 945,1205
megabyte page and put in

1620
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,220
0,320 320,530 530,755 755,1055 1055,1310
data from this table and

1621
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,930
0,195 195,495 495,890 1150,1470 1470,1710
this table and index and

1622
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,480
0,180 180,315 315,590 1510,1890 1890,2550
stuff like that. For simplicity,

1623
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,125
0,195 195,240 240,345 345,495 495,645
you're going to assume that

1624
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,600
0,210 210,525 525,960 960,1155 1155,1475
one page belongs to some

1625
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,830
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,730 1200,1490
object in the database, a

1626
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,790
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,810 810,960
table or index and so

1627
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,990
0,290 490,750 750,840 840,945 945,1200
forth, and it would only

1628
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,210
0,270 270,480 480,660 660,870 870,1220
contain data for that particular

1629
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,040
0,400
object.|

1630
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,595
0,320 320,560 560,725 725,860 860,1055
Some systems are gonna require

1631
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:15,645
0,255 255,525 525,675 675,795 795,1050
every page to be self

1632
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,835
0,365 715,1110 1110,1505 1555,1905 1905,2190
contained, meaning all the information,

1633
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,020
0,210 210,360 360,915 915,1035 1035,1185
all the metadata you need

1634
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,010
0,165 165,390 390,585 585,720 720,990
to have in order to

1635
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,440
0,330 330,720 720,945 945,1140 1140,1430
understand what's inside that page

1636
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,545
0,260 260,350 350,500 500,695 695,815
has to be included in

1637
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,920
0,105 105,330 330,695
the page itself.|

1638
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,200
0,260 260,620 620,710 710,845 845,950
So Oracle is probably the

1639
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,980
0,105 105,315 315,510 510,630 630,780
most famous one that does

1640
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,615
0,290 820,1125 1125,1275 1275,1440 1440,1635
this, right? So within a

1641
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:28,770
0,275 355,615 615,735 735,930 930,1155
page you have to keep

1642
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,835
0,165 165,300 300,555 555,825 825,1065
track of like it belongs

1643
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:31,110
0,105 105,300 300,635 865,1110 1110,1275
to this table and has

1644
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,640
0,240 240,675 675,975 975,1290 1290,1530
these columns with these types

1645
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,880
0,195 195,375 375,680
and so forth.|

1646
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,210
0,245 245,410 410,620 620,770 770,890
The reason why they want

1647
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,130
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,600 600,920
to do this is because

1648
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
0,395 395,725 725,950 950,1330 1710,2000
if there's some corruption in,

1649
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,550
0,135 135,270 270,495 495,690 690,950
you know, in the database

1650
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,690
0,400 1260,1505 1505,1700 1700,1790 1790,1910
files, you don't want to

1651
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,130
0,195 195,450 450,765 765,1140 1140,1440
have some page that contains

1652
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,590
0,320 340,930 930,1065 1065,1200 1200,1460
the metadata about the table

1653
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,085
0,305 305,560 560,845 845,1070 1070,1175
get blown away and then

1654
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:47,345
0,135 135,300 300,725 775,1035 1035,1260
now you can't understand what's

1655
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,980
0,180 180,390 390,615 615,935
in any other page.|

1656
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,880
0,400
Right.|

1657
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,705
0,275 275,845 845,1175 1175,1460 1460,1685
Again, replication can can can

1658
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:53,845
0,150 150,285 285,545 685,990 990,1140
solve this problem. Hardware has

1659
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:54,745
0,150 150,420 420,615 615,720 720,900
certainly got a lot more

1660
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,935
0,305 1195,1515 1515,1710 1710,1920 1920,2190
reliable in in modern times

1661
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,270
0,165 165,255 255,375 375,635 1015,1335
than it did before, like

1662
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,210
0,210 210,500 910,1245 1245,1635 1635,1940
hard drives, super flaky before.

1663
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,320
0,400 840,1145 1145,1250 1250,1460 1460,1730
EM, they're still not ideal,

1664
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,460
0,320 400,705 705,810 810,990 990,1140
but they're much better than

1665
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,795
0,105 105,225 225,345 345,590 970,1335
they used to be. So

1666
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,565
0,365 865,1155 1155,1365 1365,1590 1590,1770
maybe having every page be

1667
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:07,960
0,195 195,420 420,725 955,1260 1260,1395
self contained is less of

1668
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,680
0,60 60,240 240,590 1840,2240 2320,2720
an issue today, but the

1669
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,150
0,380 380,665 665,860 860,1205 1205,1450
design choice that Oracle made

1670
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,520
0,290 290,500 500,820
very early on.|

1671
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,995
0,260 260,470 470,770 770,965 965,1055
Now, every page in our

1672
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:16,745
0,180 180,420 420,585 585,675 675,750
database file is going to

1673
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:17,950
0,90 90,225 225,390 390,630 630,1205
be given a unique identifier.|

1674
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,240
0,350 430,705 705,855 855,1125 1125,1520
Like a page ID, like

1675
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,855
0,245 245,380 380,670 690,1040 1040,1415
you know, some number 64

1676
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,030
0,90 90,405 405,660 660,750 750,1175
bit {integer32 -} bit integer.|

1677
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,095
0,290 290,515 515,755 755,935 935,1265
And then there'll be some

1678
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,490
0,375 375,615 615,780 780,1085 1165,1395
method or some mechanism that

1679
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,150
0,75 75,345 345,450 450,555 555,660
the dataset is going to

1680
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,665
0,260 670,945 945,1125 1125,1320 1320,1515
use that allow it to

1681
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:30,510
0,285 285,570 570,780 780,1085 1525,1845
map a page ID to

1682
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,490
0,320 610,1010 1180,1575 1575,1830 1830,1980
some physical location on our

1683
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,140
0,240 240,590 1000,1290 1290,1485 1485,1650
storage device. And again, that

1684
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,935
0,120 120,285 285,435 435,570 570,795
could be like a file

1685
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:35,550
0,240 240,375 375,450 450,540 540,615
name and a side of

1686
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,130
0,120 120,630 630,885 885,1160 1180,1580
a directory at some offset.

1687
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,325
0,275 275,440 440,560 560,725 725,845
If we're running on like

1688
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:39,225
0,135 135,375 375,645 645,810 810,900
a cloud storage, it could

1689
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:40,310
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,780 780,1085
be an s three bucket

1690
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,895
0,290 290,560 560,815 815,950 950,1085
at some offset and so

1691
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:42,680
0,275
forth.|

1692
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,940
0,290 610,855 855,975 975,1140 1140,1260
Right. For that purpose, it

1693
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,900
0,195 195,435 435,675 675,765 765,960
doesn't matter. We just have

1694
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,815
0,210 210,345 345,465 465,645 645,915
a way to say if

1695
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:46,685
0,180 180,285 285,435 435,660 660,870
we look at page one,

1696
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,275
0,180 180,485 805,1170 1170,1365 1365,1590
two, three, there's some method

1697
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:48,950
0,150 150,285 285,510 510,600 600,675
to say, here's where to

1698
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,020
0,105 105,270 270,560
go find it.|

1699
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,020
0,230 230,460 600,980 980,1115 1115,1190
So now what's sort of

1700
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,610
0,410 520,855 855,1050 1050,1260 1260,1590
confusing in the constant database

1701
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,990
0,330 330,680 760,1095 1095,1215 1215,1380
is that there's three different

1702
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,950
0,405 405,495 495,585 585,705 705,960
notions of what a page

1703
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,220
0,240 240,500
actually is.|

1704
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,905
0,260 260,350 350,425 425,545 545,785
And so at the lowest

1705
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:01,640
0,255 255,405 405,540 540,645 645,735
level, you have what is

1706
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,340
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,800
called a Harvard page.|

1707
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,790
0,260 260,395 395,670 690,980 980,1570
This is typically four kilobytes.|

1708
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,760
0,275 275,455 455,650 650,785 785,890
And this is going to

1709
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
0,255 255,650
be the.|

1710
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,990
0,400 990,1390 1440,1840 1980,2240 2240,2500
The largest size or the

1711
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,400
0,365 365,730 870,1145 1145,1310 1310,1550
small size of a page

1712
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,740
0,350 490,765 765,930 930,1080 1080,1340
or a block of data

1713
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,360
0,275 275,440 440,680 680,905 905,1180
that the hardware can guarantee

1714
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,570
0,365 365,590 590,710 710,815 815,1190
that it can do atomic

1715
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,700
0,290
rights.|

1716
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,235
0,245 245,335 335,395 395,470 470,575
So what do I mean

1717
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:22,640
0,90 90,210 210,315 315,360 360,405
by that? What do I

1718
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,220
0,75 75,150 150,465 465,740
mean by atomic rights?|

1719
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,240
0,245 245,365 365,500 500,620 620,880
He says all or nothing,

1720
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,500
0,335 335,530 530,635 635,800 800,1120
right? So it means that

1721
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,490
0,395 395,785 785,1115 1115,1310 1310,1520
if I tell the hardware

1722
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,210
0,210 210,300 300,375 375,525 525,720
I want to write four

1723
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,890
0,590 1030,1275 1275,1380 1380,1515 1515,1680
kilobytes and I get back

1724
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,405
0,225 225,890 910,1200 1200,1365 1365,1515
an acknowledgment, yes, I wrote

1725
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:37,385
0,165 165,785 1015,1415 1555,1815 1815,1980
four kilobytes, then I can

1726
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:38,230
0,180 180,300 300,405 405,555 555,845
assume that it made it

1727
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,410
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,635 635,800
if I need to write

1728
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,040
0,255 255,980
eight kilobytes.|

1729
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,635
0,245 245,485 485,755 755,875 875,1055
And I send that as

1730
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:44,135
0,270 270,495 495,855 855,1115 1165,1500
two, four, kilobyte blocks down

1731
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:45,575
0,165 165,285 285,575 1105,1350 1350,1440
to the OS to the

1732
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,375
0,245 1015,1290 1290,1455 1455,1635 1635,1800
hardware. I may write the

1733
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,755
0,210 210,435 435,975 975,1155 1155,1380
first four kilobytes and then

1734
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,600
0,365 1015,1275 1275,1425 1425,1605 1605,1845
crash and then come back.

1735
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,640
0,210 210,470 610,1010 1120,1520 1720,2040
And then the, the second

1736
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,450
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,630 630,810
floor club by did make

1737
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,200
0,290
it.|

1738
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,890
0,320 320,455 455,760 1020,1265 1265,1460
There's no guarantee the harbor

1739
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,715
0,180 180,405 405,615 615,675 675,825
can't guarantee that I can

1740
00:42:56,715 --> 00:42:58,275
0,180 180,330 330,495 495,1145 1285,1560
do that all atomically all

1741
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,360
0,135 135,395
there. Nothing.|

1742
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,515
0,260 260,485 485,755 755,905 905,1085
And so because of this,

1743
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:01,205
0,195 195,270 270,405 405,555 555,690
we have to do much

1744
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,360
0,195 195,480 480,795 795,1020 1020,1155
other extra stuff inside our

1745
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,980
0,195 195,530 790,1190 1210,1485 1485,1620
database system to deal with

1746
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,060
0,260
that.|

1747
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:06,500
0,60 60,150 150,240 240,345 345,605
We'll get to that later.|

1748
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,740
0,260 260,515 515,830 830,1100 1100,1310
And then above that, above

1749
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,520
0,120 120,300 300,510 510,720 720,780
the Harvard. Now that's going

1750
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,855
0,60 60,290 640,960 960,1170 1170,1335
to be the operating system

1751
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:11,455
0,120 120,195 195,240 240,390 390,600
is going to have its

1752
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,330
0,150 150,345 345,510 510,615 615,875
own notion of a page.|

1753
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,240
0,245 245,365 365,620 620,830 830,1070
And in Linux, by default,

1754
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,925
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,1100 2380,2685
this is four kilobytes. And

1755
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:18,110
0,180 180,315 315,450 450,660 660,1185
again, this is like mapping

1756
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,000
0,240 240,465 465,525 525,630 630,890
something that's on the hardware

1757
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,810
0,400 600,905 905,1220 1220,1415 1415,1610
to something that's in virtual

1758
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,800
0,320
memory.|

1759
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,055
0,400 420,820 1320,1720 2100,2390 2390,2855
Now, in in X 64

1760
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,165
0,210 210,405 405,695 715,960 960,1110
they also support two different

1761
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:28,385
0,495 495,815 1225,1530 1530,1835 1945,2220
modes, or huge pages as

1762
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:29,570
0,210 210,455 805,1035 1035,1095 1095,1185
they're called, so you can

1763
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,575
0,180 180,360 360,630 630,870 870,1005
get page sizes, actually two

1764
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,120
0,405 405,510 510,660 660,1235 1255,1545
megabytes and one gigabyte. And

1765
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,250
0,195 195,375 375,585 585,885 885,1130
again, the hardware can't guarantee

1766
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,040
0,245 245,350 350,485 485,620 620,740
that it can. It can

1767
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,980
0,135 135,410
write out.|

1768
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,915
0,290 290,620 620,1210 1290,1610 1610,1925
Four kilobytes atomically is just

1769
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:37,770
0,300 300,495 495,630 630,720 720,855
to reduce the amount of

1770
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,110
0,510 510,705 705,870 870,1050 1050,1340
bookkeeping that the OS does

1771
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,935
0,350 350,560 560,820 870,1130 1130,1235
for the pages that it

1772
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,240
0,135 135,315 315,605
brings into memory.|

1773
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,290
0,245 245,350 350,575 575,860 860,1130
And then with inside that

1774
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,075
0,330 330,600 600,890 1300,1560 1560,1785
now above that, the database

1775
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:46,645
0,255 255,390 390,450 450,495 495,570
system is going to have

1776
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:47,305
0,105 105,240 240,420 420,555 555,660
its own notion of a

1777
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:48,500
0,150 150,300 300,575
page as well.|

1778
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,260
0,400
Right.|

1779
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,655
0,335 335,650 650,890 890,1010 1010,1115
And typically, this is going

1780
00:43:51,655 --> 00:43:52,675
0,105 105,365 625,855 855,930 930,1020
to be anywhere in the

1781
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:53,640
0,165 165,375 375,525 525,675 675,965
range of five hundred twelve,

1782
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,690
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,1090 1260,1490
five hundred, twelve bytes. This

1783
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,145
0,75 75,285 285,570 570,830 1120,1455
is what lightte does up

1784
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,570
0,315 315,540 540,675 675,1035 1035,1425
to, I {think32 -} kilobytes.

1785
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,485
0,290 430,690 690,780 780,840 840,915
Some let you go up

1786
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,120
0,180 180,615 615,1115
to 64 kilobytes.|

1787
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,805
0,400 1380,1670 1670,1880 1880,2195 2195,2555
Right. And so the page

1788
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:05,155
0,365 415,810 810,1050 1050,1140 1140,1350
size is going to be

1789
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:06,655
0,240 240,465 465,750 750,995 1225,1500
the way we'll represent. Where

1790
00:44:06,655 --> 00:44:09,360
0,165 165,455 1975,2265 2265,2430 2430,2705
to find the page ID

1791
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,650
0,245 245,350 350,545 545,725 725,970
is a way to represent.|

1792
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,730
0,365 365,730 870,1175 1175,1400 1400,1700
At what offset in some

1793
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,740
0,380 1210,1440 1440,1515 1515,1710 1710,2010
file for a given page

1794
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,420
0,350 700,960 960,1110 1110,1400 1420,1680
size, can we find the

1795
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,580
0,255 255,510 510,660 660,825 825,1160
data that we're looking for?|

1796
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,745
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,680 680,965
So, okay, this said, most

1797
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:21,930
0,255 255,570 570,900 900,1095 1095,1185
systems are the default is

1798
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,090
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,980 1840,2160
going be four kilobytes in

1799
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,740
0,300 300,435 435,600 600,1100 1330,1650
sql server and postgres the

1800
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,625
0,195 195,375 375,600 600,795 795,885
the page size is going

1801
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,050
0,30 30,105 105,255 255,845 1165,1425
to be eight kilobytes. And

1802
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,235
0,195 195,420 420,600 600,960 960,1185
then in my sql they

1803
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:31,070
0,120 120,255 255,545 925,1260 1260,1835
go up to sixteen kilobytes

1804
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,580
0,400 420,695 695,860 860,1160 1160,1310
for something like DB two

1805
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,735
0,105 105,560 580,840 840,990 990,1155
and enterprises actually for for

1806
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:35,175
0,270 270,545 745,1020 1020,1185 1185,1440
DB two on a per

1807
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,500
0,300 300,615 615,855 855,1020 1020,1325
table basis, you can change

1808
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,140
0,320 320,500 500,665 665,970
the, the page size.|

1809
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,520
0,230 230,350 350,485 485,575 575,820
And I take a guess,

1810
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,670
0,305 305,485 485,605 605,680 680,860
would anybody take a guess

1811
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,005
0,345 345,645 645,885 885,1155 1155,1335
why one page size, a

1812
00:44:43,005 --> 00:44:43,830
0,165 165,375 375,585 585,750 750,825
larger page size, might be

1813
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,240
0,75 75,300 300,680
a better idea?|

1814
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,260
0,245 245,320 320,410 410,500 500,560
What did I say in

1815
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,025
0,105 105,380 400,630 630,690 690,765
the beginning? What do we

1816
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:50,810
0,75 75,150 150,225 225,300 300,785
want to try to maximize?|

1817
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,590
0,615 615,825 825,1080 1080,1430 1690,2010
Sequentialis correct, yes. So if

1818
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,170
0,225 225,480 480,830 2080,2325 2325,2580
I now have, if I'm

1819
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,045
0,300 300,525 525,1100 1210,1605 1605,1875
organizing on disk, sixteen kil

1820
00:44:58,045 --> 00:44:59,480
0,210 210,485
byte blocks.|

1821
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,665
0,320 400,675 675,825 825,960 960,1185
And I need to read

1822
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,840
0,345 345,795 795,885 885,1145 1825,2175
sixteen kilobytes of data. Then

1823
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,120
0,315 315,590 820,1220 1570,1950 1950,2280
it's one one call to

1824
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,600
0,300 300,650 1210,1815 1815,2030 2080,2480
to our dispatcher in in

1825
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,470
0,260 260,455 455,790 990,1250 1250,1400
the database system that makes

1826
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,300
0,180 180,315 315,405 405,540 540,830
one call into the OS

1827
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,755
0,260 260,455 455,790 900,1690 1950,2285
to go grab contiguous sixteen

1828
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:13,940
0,665
kilobytes.|

1829
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,480
0,275 275,455 455,605 605,845 845,1160
If I'm using four kilobyte

1830
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,170
0,210 210,405 405,510 510,600 600,690
pages, then I got to

1831
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,975
0,210 210,525 525,890 2200,2565 2565,2805
make separate calls or do

1832
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,815
0,180 180,525 525,600 600,720 720,840
separate lookups to go get

1833
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:21,240
0,105 105,285 285,605 805,1125 1125,1425
the data in potentially random

1834
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,440
0,380
locations.|

1835
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,525
0,245 245,455 455,850 870,1175 1175,1355
And there's, there's sis calls

1836
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:25,260
0,150 150,255 255,435 435,600 600,735
you can make to the

1837
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,030
0,290 820,1185 1185,1455 1455,1620 1620,1770
OS are to, to the

1838
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,320
0,270 270,650 790,1065 1065,1185 1185,1290
device itself that when you

1839
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,535
0,435 435,705 705,930 930,1050 1050,1215
allocate data that you want

1840
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:31,545
0,225 225,390 390,635 715,1410 1410,2010
things to be ideally contigously

1841
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:32,490
0,315 315,525 525,615 615,780 780,945
aligned, you can like pre

1842
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,800
0,330 330,540 540,825 825,1035 1035,1310
allocate an extent to say

1843
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,225
0,575 575,880 900,1205 1205,1415 1415,1925
allocate me a ten megabyte

1844
00:45:36,225 --> 00:45:37,580
0,150 150,285 285,545 835,1095 1095,1355
block of data and then

1845
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,435
0,260 260,380 380,545 545,740 740,965
then the data system can

1846
00:45:39,435 --> 00:45:40,440
0,255 255,465 465,600 600,840 840,1005
divide that ten megyte block

1847
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,420
0,290 850,1095 1095,1335 1335,1620 1620,1980
into, you know, eight kilobyte

1848
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,950
0,225 225,375 375,680 1090,1380 1380,1530
chunks or whatever block size

1849
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,840
0,105 105,350 370,770
it wants. Yes?|

1850
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,240
0,680
Don't.|

1851
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,975
0,180 180,315 315,405 405,525 525,735
Right, so then he says,

1852
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:51,805
0,195 195,405 405,665 1345,1725 1725,1830
and he's correct. Doesn't this

1853
00:45:51,805 --> 00:45:52,855
0,135 135,270 270,495 495,735 735,1050
mean that large pay sizes

1854
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:54,430
0,375 375,690 690,945 945,1265 1285,1575
make rights more expensive? Because

1855
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,180
0,210 210,375 375,480 480,615 615,750
now if I only have

1856
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,695
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,1250 1270,1515
to write one kilobyte but

1857
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:57,895
0,135 135,285 285,495 495,780 780,1200
I'm storing as sixteen kilobyte

1858
00:45:57,895 --> 00:45:58,570
0,195 195,405 405,510 510,585 585,675
page, I got to write

1859
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,115
0,105 105,240 240,465 465,920 1240,1545
it all. Sixteen kiloby absolutely

1860
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:01,195
0,305 505,795 795,915 915,990 990,1080
yes. So this is a

1861
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:02,440
0,135 135,425 685,945 945,1065 1065,1245
good point. This is something

1862
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,370
0,195 195,345 345,540 540,765 765,930
I would say throughout the

1863
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,905
0,165 165,500 1000,1400 2020,2400 2400,2535
entire semester. Ah, its, I

1864
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:07,270
0,105 105,360 360,525 525,1080 1080,1365
mean that's for databases, computer

1865
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,410
0,165 165,285 285,530 640,990 990,1140
science in general. There's no

1866
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,015
0,165 165,440 730,1170 1170,1425 1425,1605
free lunch. There's pros and

1867
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:11,320
0,275 685,930 930,1035 1035,1140 1140,1305
cons to each of these

1868
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,690
0,270 270,620 640,1040 1660,2060 2080,2370
and different situations. One approach

1869
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,430
0,135 135,225 225,360 360,495 495,740
might be better than another.|

1870
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,185
0,225 225,465 465,795 795,960 960,1245
If my workload is entirely

1871
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:17,190
0,240 240,465 465,660 660,795 795,1005
read, only if I never

1872
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,435
0,315 315,710 730,990 990,1125 1125,1245
write anything, then yeah, I

1873
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:19,680
0,120 120,315 315,510 510,815 955,1245
want large page sizes, assuming

1874
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,990
0,180 180,405 405,690 690,1020 1020,1310
I'm doing large sequential scans.

1875
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,080
0,245 245,440 440,545 545,650 650,770
If I'm doing much of

1876
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,010
0,255 255,540 540,690 690,795 795,930
writes, then maybe I want

1877
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,360
0,240 240,590 850,1110 1110,1245 1245,1350
something smaller, but what the

1878
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,640
0,120 120,285 285,560
right amount is?|

1879
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,655
0,400 930,1220 1220,1385 1385,1505 1505,1595
Depends, of course, you would

1880
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:28,525
0,120 120,255 255,360 360,540 540,870
have some kind of readed

1881
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,470
0,240 240,570 570,810 810,885 885,945
cool, similar if you had

1882
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,505
0,120 120,315 315,540 540,795 795,1035
a small page size. So

1883
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:31,645
0,305 355,615 615,780 780,915 915,1140
effectively if you look many

1884
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:32,940
0,180 180,285 285,875
for a kilobyte.|

1885
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,405
0,305 305,470 470,620 620,875 875,1445
Seven to say sixteen kilobytes

1886
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:36,300
0,150 150,575
of reed.|

1887
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,120
0,270 270,465 465,720 720,1070
Head food system call.|

1888
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,945
0,120 120,255 360,480 480,645 645,825
And then you'll still have

1889
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:40,000
0,195 195,485
the right.|

1890
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,570
0,290 290,440 440,710 710,965 965,1190
So if you're writing, you

1891
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:47,480
0,180 180,465 465,1160 4540,4940
still have atomic statement.|

1892
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,225
0,290 290,485 485,665 665,905 905,1325
If I do, sixteen kilobyte

1893
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:50,530
0,395 565,810 810,960 960,1080 1080,1305
reads and I'm still using

1894
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,990
0,255 255,870 870,1155 1155,1460 2140,2460
four kilobytes of data, assuming

1895
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,630
0,210 210,450 450,885 885,1005 1005,1640
that sixteen kilobytes is contiguous.|

1896
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,380
0,165 165,450 450,585 585,810 810,1080
Then can't I go make

1897
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,705
0,350 1330,1560 1560,1740 1740,2010 2010,2325
a, you know, go make

1898
00:46:58,705 --> 00:46:59,665
0,285 285,510 510,720 720,825 825,960
a single call to get

1899
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:00,870
0,240 240,585 585,645 645,705 705,1205
sixteen kilobytes that are contiguous.

1900
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:01,855
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,530 530,605
And then if I had

1901
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:04,510
0,135 135,425 505,905 1495,1895 2065,2655
the right individual within fourbytes,

1902
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,035
0,105 105,195 195,300 300,420 420,525
I can still write those

1903
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,670
0,245 535,840 840,1145 1315,1560 1560,1635
out? Absolutely yes. And this

1904
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,000
0,45 45,90 90,150 150,225 225,330
is what I was saying

1905
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,190
0,240 240,480 480,600 600,825 825,1190
before. We will then choose

1906
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,670
0,380 380,545 545,815 815,1175 1175,1460
algorithms or methods that that

1907
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,585
0,180 180,330 330,525 525,705 705,915
try to write that data

1908
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:11,680
0,335
out.|

1909
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,210
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,605 605,1070
So that it is contiguous

1910
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,155
0,165 165,315 315,465 465,645 645,945
so that we can do

1911
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:15,500
0,285 285,755
those fetches.|

1912
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,600
0,320 1210,1500 1500,1755 1755,1980 1980,2100
Right. And again, this is

1913
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,500
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,720 720,900
something a data system can

1914
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,310
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,645 645,810
do for us because we

1915
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,240
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,720 720,930
know what the query is.

1916
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,215
0,165 165,345 345,540 540,765 765,975
We know what data you're

1917
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,340
0,30 30,105 105,315 315,665 865,1125
going to potentially read, and

1918
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,015
0,90 90,150 150,255 255,450 450,675
so we can read ahead

1919
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:23,660
0,195 195,330 330,435 435,555 555,645
for you and try to

1920
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,135
0,165 165,390 390,710 970,1370 2140,2475
fetch things that are before

1921
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,605
0,240 240,405 405,540 540,815 1195,1470
you actually need them. Now

1922
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:28,475
0,195 195,420 420,570 570,675 675,870
the OS can do that

1923
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:29,680
0,300 300,525 525,810 810,930 930,1205
with pref fetching as well,

1924
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,025
0,245 245,350 350,455 455,605 605,965
but it can only prefetch

1925
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:33,470
0,180 180,285 285,360 360,965 2185,2445
things that are contiguous in

1926
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,430
0,165 165,420 420,615 615,780 780,960
both directions. I think in

1927
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,795
0,270 270,560 670,900 900,1035 1035,1365
Linux, yes, but it can't

1928
00:47:35,795 --> 00:47:36,995
0,305 715,960 960,1035 1035,1095 1095,1200
do if I have to

1929
00:47:36,995 --> 00:47:37,955
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,735 735,960
pref fetch things that aren't

1930
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:38,930
0,435 435,585 585,765 765,840 840,975
contiguous. It can't do that

1931
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:39,620
0,150 150,410
for me.|

1932
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,305
0,215 215,275 275,410 410,590 590,725
So this is clear. So

1933
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:44,085
0,135 135,300 300,405 405,570 570,780
again there be some page

1934
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:45,285
0,305 655,900 900,1035 1035,1110 1110,1200
ID and we'll see this

1935
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:45,915
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,510 510,630
in a second. How this

1936
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:47,055
0,105 105,255 255,545 775,1095 1095,1140
is being used that's going

1937
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:49,260
0,60 60,150 150,395 685,1085 1915,2205
to allow us page page

1938
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,355
0,150 150,285 285,560 670,1020 1020,1095
one, o three, here's where

1939
00:47:50,355 --> 00:47:51,440
0,75 75,165 165,300 300,575
to go find it.|

1940
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,040
0,335 335,670
Right, so.|

1941
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,970
0,260 260,425 425,455 455,515 515,620
Now we've got to talk

1942
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:57,720
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,585 585,750
about how do we actually

1943
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,730
0,150 150,360 360,680 1270,1590 1590,2010
keep track of that mapping

1944
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,400
0,150 150,330 330,810 810,1130 1270,1670
of page IDs to locations,

1945
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,845
0,400 990,1385 1385,1870 2310,2570 2570,2675
EM and there this would

1946
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:05,325
0,120 120,225 225,285 285,360 360,480
be one of the big

1947
00:48:05,325 --> 00:48:06,450
0,275 295,585 585,810 810,990 990,1125
differences of how the data

1948
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,700
0,165 165,270 270,450 450,855 855,1250
centers are going organize the

1949
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,650
0,245 245,365 365,640 2100,2390 2390,2630
and their pages. And again,

1950
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,490
0,285 285,405 405,555 555,660 660,840
there's not, I'm not saying

1951
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,330
0,195 195,360 360,480 480,645 645,840
one way is better than

1952
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,250
0,290 550,930 930,1250 1510,1770 1770,1920
another. I'll describe the heat

1953
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,135
0,240 240,480 480,645 645,750 750,885
file approach is the most

1954
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,670
0,255 255,605 1825,2130 2130,2355 2355,2535
common one, but certainly a

1955
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,540
0,120 120,210 210,345 345,630 630,870
bunch of other systems are

1956
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,080
0,225 225,510 510,830
doing different things.|

1957
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,355
0,245 245,305 305,395 395,650 650,725
And there are tradeoffs for

1958
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:22,640
0,120 120,270 270,545
all these ones.|

1959
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,010
0,400 900,1190 1190,1430 1430,1685 1685,1820
So at this point, where

1960
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,360
0,165 165,255 255,450 450,800 1090,1350
we're in our discussion, we

1961
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,110
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,555 555,750
don't need to know anything

1962
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:27,740
0,120 120,315 315,450 450,540 540,630
about what's inside of our

1963
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,015
0,260 460,780 780,990 990,1125 1125,1275
pages. Like, again, we don't

1964
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:30,230
0,90 90,335 445,795 795,1095 1095,1215
care whether it's indexes or

1965
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,400
0,380 580,825 825,915 915,1035 1035,1170
twoils. We just need to

1966
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,320
0,210 210,375 375,435 435,600 600,920
know for a given page,

1967
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:33,800
0,245 245,320 320,395 395,530 530,710
how do I go find

1968
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,595
0,270 270,495 495,585 585,675 675,795
it and how to keep

1969
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:35,480
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,615 615,885
track of what pages I

1970
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,520
0,180 180,440
actually have.|

1971
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,970
0,400 570,860 860,1085 1085,1280 1280,1540
So tree falls is basically

1972
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,180
0,305 305,610
you store.|

1973
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,275
0,260 260,410 410,605 605,910 1620,1895
You can store the sort

1974
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:44,115
0,120 120,225 225,405 405,765 765,840
in the leaf nodes. You

1975
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:44,840
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,480 480,725
can sort the actual pages

1976
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,425
0,400 840,1190 1190,1385 1385,1475 1475,1565
themselves or you can have

1977
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,225
0,90 90,300 300,575 955,1355 1465,1800
a hash table. I is

1978
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,130
0,225 225,515 1075,1350 1350,1665 1665,1905
a am or sequential sorted

1979
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,600
0,260 640,915 915,1050 1050,1245 1245,1470
files. This is something from

1980
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,025
0,180 180,360 360,585 585,920 1120,1425
like the seventy s, my

1981
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:53,970
0,285 285,405 405,645 645,855 855,945
sql used to do this

1982
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,290
0,180 180,500 640,975 975,1110 1110,1320
by default. It's not that

1983
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,895
0,320 370,770 1000,1305 1305,1455 1455,1605
common anymore, but again it's

1984
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:57,600
0,150 150,315 315,435 435,540 540,705
another way to sort of

1985
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,545
0,195 195,330 330,435 435,680 700,945
keep track of things and

1986
00:48:58,545 --> 00:48:59,715
0,105 105,420 420,615 615,855 855,1170
then hashing file is going

1987
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:00,495
0,300 300,450 450,600 600,675 675,780
use the hash table. Bunch

1988
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:01,695
0,455 505,810 810,990 990,1125 1125,1200
lookups he files is going

1989
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,385
0,30 30,105 105,270 270,465 465,690
to be the most common

1990
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:03,120
0,335
one.|

1991
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,570
0,335 335,530 530,695 695,1000 1260,1660
But these other methods exist,

1992
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:06,855
0,260 260,395 395,500 500,605 605,845
and then for the log

1993
00:49:06,855 --> 00:49:07,755
0,300 300,510 510,690 690,780 780,900
structure stuff, we'll see that

1994
00:49:07,755 --> 00:49:10,140
0,195 195,515
next class.|

1995
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,340
0,400 660,1115 1115,1235 1235,1415 1415,1640
The directory is really keeping

1996
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,440
0,320 370,645 645,765 765,855 855,1100
track. You still want to

1997
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,875
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,800 800,935
keep track of where things

1998
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,200
0,275 1195,1485 1485,1710 1710,1985 2065,2325
are because don't care. We

1999
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,310
0,165 165,410 490,855 855,990 990,1110
don't care what's inside the

2000
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,120
0,260
pages.|

2001
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,015
0,320 320,530 530,710 710,965 965,1175
Right. So he file is

2002
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:25,710
0,75 75,135 135,365 1135,1455 1455,1695
going to be a collection

2003
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,990
0,240 240,690 690,950 1870,2130 2130,2280
of unordered pages where our

2004
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,650
0,180 180,315 315,405 405,540 540,660
tools will be stored in

2005
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,760
0,165 165,470 640,900 900,1020 1020,1110
random order. And again, the

2006
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,810
0,255 255,525 525,765 765,930 930,1050
relational model allows us to

2007
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,055
0,135 135,410 430,825 825,1050 1050,1245
do that because the relational

2008
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,020
0,195 195,510 510,815 955,1445 1645,1965
model doesn't define, doesn't says,

2009
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,860
0,165 165,270 270,450 450,735 735,840
that the data doesn't have

2010
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,660
0,120 120,380 670,1185 1185,1485 1485,1800
to be specified in exact

2011
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,660
0,320
order.|

2012
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,240
0,305 305,590 590,875 875,1235 1235,1540
Some systems might presort them

2013
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,215
0,245 245,365 365,640 690,1055 1055,1265
to make things faster for

2014
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,825
0,245 745,1065 1065,1385 2125,2385 2385,2610
other effects, but the relational

2015
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:44,950
0,255 255,690 690,900 900,1020 1020,1125
model doesn't require you to

2016
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,000
0,120 120,380
do that.|

2017
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,470
0,260 260,395 395,515 515,695 695,1220
And so the only API

2018
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,760
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,920 970,1290
we need in our storage

2019
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,110
0,320 580,900 900,1095 1095,1200 1200,1350
manager to support a heap

2020
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,805
0,260 580,930 930,1245 1245,1500 1500,1695
file is basically to create

2021
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,725
0,305 535,795 795,915 915,1175 1615,1920
pages, get a page, write

2022
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,420
0,120 120,210 210,485 1285,1560 1560,1695
to a page, delete a

2023
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,745
0,260 640,930 930,1220 1570,1875 1875,2325
page, and then an iterator

2024
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,815
0,450 450,600 600,875 1045,1445 1705,2070
API that allows to to

2025
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:01,930
0,540 540,810 810,1175 1765,2010 2010,2115
sequentially read pages to get

2026
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:02,545
0,90 90,195 195,315 315,465 465,615
the list of all the

2027
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:03,415
0,120 120,330 330,525 525,630 630,870
page ID that we have

2028
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:04,700
0,255 255,375 375,525 525,815
and read over them.|

2029
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,080
0,400
So.|

2030
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,235
0,395 395,650 650,785 785,950 950,1115
Managing this heat file is

2031
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:09,600
0,165 165,375 375,555 555,815 1075,1365
really easy to do if

2032
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,545
0,150 150,375 375,600 600,735 735,945
your database is a single

2033
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:12,135
0,330 330,600 600,1230 1230,1410 1410,1590
file, like inducteeb or like

2034
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,380
0,305 325,725 835,1170 1170,1445
in in sql lite.|

2035
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,355
0,335 335,530 530,680 680,815 815,935
Right, because all you need

2036
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,225
0,120 120,300 300,525 525,720 720,870
to do to find a

2037
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:18,010
0,165 165,485 985,1320 1320,1575 1575,1785
given page is just know

2038
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:18,835
0,165 165,315 315,450 450,615 615,825
what pa the page number

2039
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:20,095
0,305 685,945 945,1035 1035,1110 1110,1260
is. You know what the

2040
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:21,085
0,270 270,465 465,555 555,735 735,990
size of the page is

2041
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:21,640
0,195 195,315 315,405 405,480 480,555
because they all have to

2042
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,110
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,710 1210,1470
be the same size. And

2043
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:23,635
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,450 450,525
now you just do a

2044
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:25,510
0,120 120,675 675,995 1225,1560 1560,1875
simple arithmetic like take whatever

2045
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,730
0,270 270,495 495,720 720,885 885,1220
the ID I'm looking for,

2046
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,975
0,620 620,815 815,1070 1070,1450 1620,1895
multiply it by the the

2047
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:30,145
0,165 165,285 285,375 375,635 925,1170
size of the page and

2048
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:30,820
0,90 90,195 195,330 330,510 510,675
then I can jump to

2049
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,705
0,120 120,345 345,585 585,750 750,885
whatever that offset is in

2050
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:32,580
0,105 105,365
the file.|

2051
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,600
0,230 230,305 305,440 440,635 635,770
And I know exactly what

2052
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:34,680
0,45 45,195 195,515
I'm looking for.|

2053
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,390
0,230 230,290 290,380 380,640 660,920
And if you go look

2054
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,590
0,105 105,255 255,510 510,690 690,1200
in the sql like documentation,

2055
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,870
0,330 330,585 585,810 810,1005 1005,1280
they, they talk about how

2056
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,440
0,290 290,440 440,560 560,815 815,920
in, in the header of

2057
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,900
0,150 150,315 315,590 850,1155 1155,1460
their of their data file,

2058
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,530
0,335 335,515 515,725 725,965 965,1520
all sort of the metadata

2059
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,595
0,210 210,330 330,465 465,720 720,1065
they keep track of basically

2060
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,180
0,345 345,615 615,780 780,1055
do this trick here.|

2061
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,730
0,320 320,530 530,710 710,995 995,1160
Where things get tricky is

2062
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,585
0,180 180,270 270,345 345,555 555,855
if you have multiple files,

2063
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,010
0,225 225,515 565,870 870,1140 1140,1425
which again, most systems do,

2064
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,090
0,375 375,540 540,690 690,900 900,1080
presres does, my sql does,

2065
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,360
0,330 330,590
Oracle does.|

2066
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,110
0,120 120,255 255,465 465,645 645,750
And then now we need

2067
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,370
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,740 1000,1260
a way to say for

2068
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,245
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,980 1540,1875
given page number two, what

2069
00:50:58,245 --> 00:51:01,290
0,330 330,660 660,2580 2580,2775 2775,3045
file and whatory what file,

2070
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,900
0,330 330,680 910,1200 1200,1350 1350,1610
what offset has the page

2071
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,100
0,365 365,605 605,880
that I need.|

2072
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,535
0,400 720,965 965,1085 1085,1205 1205,1295
Right. And this is what

2073
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:09,510
0,90 90,255 255,450 450,675 675,975
a heap file page directory

2074
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:10,400
0,120 120,315 315,525 525,645 645,890
can get get for us.

2075
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,490
0,290 290,440 440,665 665,935 935,980
Again, think of it's like

2076
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,155
0,90 90,330 330,590 1210,1485 1485,1665
a hash table where you're

2077
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,070
0,90 90,270 270,465 465,660 660,915
just keeping track of. It's

2078
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,050
0,330 330,450 450,570 570,705 705,980
mapping from the page ID

2079
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,385
0,400 1050,1450 1560,1820 1820,2030 2030,2225
to to the pages in

2080
00:51:17,385 --> 00:51:18,700
0,105 105,285 285,605
the data file.|

2081
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,625
0,275 275,455 455,760 780,1180 1530,1775
And this typically be sort

2082
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,750
0,150 150,420 420,765 765,1005 1005,1125
of special file, either at

2083
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,460
0,135 135,420 420,615 615,920 1450,1710
the header of, of the

2084
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,705
0,150 150,345 345,650 790,1065 1065,1245
single database file or at

2085
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:26,390
0,300 300,690 690,1085 1135,1410 1410,1685
some special location inside of

2086
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,795
0,245 245,440 440,725 725,905 905,1025
the database system and a

2087
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,355
0,455 985,1230 1230,1335 1335,1455 1455,1560
directory. And you can sort

2088
00:51:29,355 --> 00:51:30,195
0,90 90,240 240,465 465,570 570,840
of think it's a database.

2089
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:31,515
0,315 315,510 510,785 895,1200 1200,1320
When the database, it's the

2090
00:51:31,515 --> 00:51:32,490
0,270 270,525 525,675 675,840 840,975
database that keeps track of

2091
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,355
0,225 225,360 360,525 525,800 2590,2865
what's in your database. The

2092
00:51:35,355 --> 00:51:36,090
0,315 315,450 450,570 570,645 645,735
catalog is part of that

2093
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:36,705
0,135 135,285 285,405 405,510 510,615
is too. But this is

2094
00:51:36,705 --> 00:51:37,620
0,240 240,525 525,690 690,810 810,915
like keeping track where the

2095
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,240
0,255 255,585 585,810 810,1100
physical location things are.|

2096
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,670
0,260 260,440 440,665 665,860 860,980
And so this has to

2097
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,280
0,105 105,270 270,495 495,950 1210,1610
be kept in sync with

2098
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,060
0,320 320,530 530,755 755,995 995,1490
the actual files on disk

2099
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,485
0,320 730,1020 1020,1230 1230,1320 1320,1425
because I don't want to

2100
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:46,150
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,405 405,665
create a bunch of page,

2101
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,100
0,380 380,620 620,755 755,965 965,1510
not update my page directory.

2102
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,340
0,320 320,545 545,710 710,845 845,1040
I crash and come back.

2103
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,440
0,165 165,270 270,405 405,600 600,1100
And now my page directory

2104
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,440
0,380 380,560 560,740 740,845 845,980
doesn't know about these other

2105
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,285
0,290 820,1125 1125,1410 1410,1725 1725,1845
pages and I can't get

2106
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:54,160
0,120 120,365
to them.|

2107
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,540
0,320 320,485 485,725 725,1070 1070,1220
Right. So there's, there's a

2108
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,275
0,120 120,210 210,375 375,645 645,735
bunch of extra tricks we

2109
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:56,770
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,375 375,495
have to do to make

2110
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:57,750
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,660 660,980
sure that these things are

2111
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,100
0,260 260,410 410,760
kept in sync.|

2112
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,985
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,665 665,785
Okay, so just thinking like

2113
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:01,830
0,195 195,390 390,480 480,585 585,845
I have a bunch of

2114
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,340
0,400 480,845 845,1070 1070,1280 1280,1430
pages. They're some, they're on

2115
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,450
0,320 460,765 765,915 915,1005 1005,1110
some location, a bunch of

2116
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,130
0,210 210,495 495,645 645,950 1420,1680
files, doesn't matter where, and

2117
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,450
0,260 430,750 750,840 840,975 975,1320
then it's just a mapping

2118
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,005
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,465 465,555
to tell me where to

2119
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,040
0,105 105,255 255,545
go find it.|

2120
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,935
0,335 335,755 755,905 905,1085 1085,1295
Additional metada we keep track

2121
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:12,105
0,210 210,515 535,780 780,930 930,1170
of like for every single

2122
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:13,230
0,300 300,525 525,720 720,945 945,1125
page, we can keep track

2123
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,745
0,180 180,360 360,615 615,980 1270,1515
of an essential location, the

2124
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:15,540
0,105 105,225 225,390 390,630 630,795
number of free slots that

2125
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,145
0,165 165,345 345,620 850,1250 1300,1605
they actually have, or free

2126
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:18,630
0,210 210,375 375,635 985,1245 1245,1485
space they have. So now

2127
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:19,380
0,225 225,345 345,465 465,540 540,750
if I want to insert

2128
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,610
0,135 135,300 300,590 850,1110 1110,1230
a two pool and I

2129
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,135
0,90 90,165 165,270 270,390 390,525
got to find a page

2130
00:52:21,135 --> 00:52:22,110
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,605 715,975
to put it in, I

2131
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:22,575
0,165 165,195 195,240 240,315 315,465
don't want to have to

2132
00:52:22,575 --> 00:52:23,235
0,195 195,315 315,405 405,540 540,660
scan them all and figure

2133
00:52:23,235 --> 00:52:24,230
0,105 105,315 315,465 465,690 690,995
out who's got free space.

2134
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,965
0,305 305,545 545,920 920,1100 1100,1235
My page directory would tell

2135
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:26,820
0,120 120,365
me that.|

2136
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,160
0,400
Right.|

2137
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,670
0,275 275,425 425,545 545,695 695,860
And then if I run

2138
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,795
0,120 120,285 285,590 730,990 990,1125
out of pages, I know

2139
00:52:30,795 --> 00:52:31,530
0,105 105,165 165,495 495,630 630,735
how to allocate them and

2140
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,535
0,150 150,315 315,435 435,615 615,1005
then update my page directory

2141
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:33,440
0,195 195,330 330,480 480,630 630,905
to point this as well.|

2142
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,740
0,320 320,500 500,680 680,845 845,920
Again, just think, think of

2143
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,910
0,90 90,315 315,590 700,1035 1035,1170
a hash table that get

2144
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,855
0,180 180,330 330,660 660,810 810,945
written to disk that keeps

2145
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:39,470
0,135 135,240 240,330 330,480 480,615
track of the pages that

2146
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,310
0,75 75,320 400,645 645,735 735,840
I have, but then I

2147
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,810
0,225 225,570 570,1065 1065,1275 1275,1500
can also iterate or scan

2148
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,040
0,195 195,330 330,590 760,1095 1095,1230
through and say here's page

2149
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,105
0,210 210,480 480,615 615,810 810,1065
one, here's page two, here's

2150
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:44,825
0,165 165,405 405,555 555,690 690,720
page three because we're going

2151
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:45,965
0,60 60,210 210,515 745,1005 1005,1140
to need this if we

2152
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:46,985
0,135 135,345 345,570 570,810 810,1020
have an access method like

2153
00:52:46,985 --> 00:52:48,760
0,105 105,435 435,705 705,1085
a sequential scan operator.|

2154
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,450
0,245 245,335 335,485 485,545 545,680
If we don't have an

2155
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,140
0,180 180,315 315,420 420,570 570,690
index, we need to be

2156
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,490
0,75 75,165 165,435 435,710 1000,1350
able to iterate over every

2157
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,410
0,255 255,450 450,555 555,660 660,920
single tube on the table.

2158
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,010
0,245 245,365 365,590 590,950 950,1070
So the page directory needs

2159
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,225
0,90 90,255 255,495 495,800 910,1215
to be exposed as that,

2160
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:56,710
0,165 165,630 630,1020 1020,1320 1320,1485
that API. Yes, yes. So

2161
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,760
0,120 120,380 400,690 690,885 885,1050
you mentioned in case of

2162
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,980
0,195 195,480 480,705 705,900 900,1220
foot crash. So that means

2163
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,400
0,275 275,470 470,845 845,1055 1055,1310
because the directory is part

2164
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,945
0,240 240,525 525,990 990,1275 1275,1545
of the volatile memory too.

2165
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,380
0,225 225,450 450,660 660,995
I also have to.|

2166
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,110
0,290 290,410 410,500 500,665 665,970
Yeah, so his question is

2167
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,280
0,350 350,590 590,1090
because the directory.|

2168
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:08,775
0,135 135,225 225,285 285,360 360,495
It has to be brought

2169
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:09,300
0,90 90,135 135,270 270,420 420,525
in a memory in order

2170
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,340
0,120 120,255 255,530 1390,1815 1815,2040
to read it. It's, it's

2171
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,120
0,90 90,255 255,375 375,585 585,780
a non v volatile memory.

2172
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,010
0,210 210,315 315,405 405,570 570,890
So now if I crash,

2173
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:14,730
0,245 245,365 365,410 410,485 485,620
I don't want to lose

2174
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,765
0,270 270,510 510,660 660,825 825,1035
it. Does that mean any

2175
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:16,545
0,270 270,465 465,600 600,705 705,780
changes I make to it

2176
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:17,025
0,105 105,180 180,255 255,375 375,480
have to be written a

2177
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:18,360
0,285 285,575
disk? Yes.|

2178
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,855
0,400 1050,1450 1530,1850 1850,2165 2165,2315
But like, but it's not

2179
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:23,075
0,180 180,465 465,845 1015,1415 1945,2220
as bad as like you're

2180
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,005
0,210 210,555 555,675 675,795 795,930
not updating this thing all

2181
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,570
0,150 150,425 865,1260 1260,1655 2245,2565
the time, right? So you're

2182
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,455
0,135 135,285 285,495 495,705 705,885
not going to, you know,

2183
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:28,070
0,180 180,285 285,390 390,480 480,615
if you run out of

2184
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,670
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,495 495,600
space in your, in your

2185
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,855
0,195 195,465 465,720 720,1050 1050,1185
database file and allocate more

2186
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:31,025
0,275 655,945 945,1035 1035,1125 1125,1170
pages, you're not going to

2187
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:32,920
0,285 285,435 435,660 660,995 1495,1895
allocate just one page, right?

2188
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,980
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,590 590,740
Because then you can potentially

2189
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,445
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,360 360,465
you do that for every

2190
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,080
0,165 165,485 655,930 930,1395 1395,1635
single query you allocate. Like

2191
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,085
0,180 180,360 360,585 585,930 930,1005
you know a gigabyte of

2192
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:38,870
0,245 775,1050 1050,1185 1185,1365 1365,1785
data. Update your page directory

2193
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:39,845
0,225 225,405 405,555 555,675 675,975
that gets written to disk

2194
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:40,955
0,275 445,705 705,840 840,960 960,1110
once you make sure that's

2195
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:42,340
0,315 315,450 450,600 600,845
persisted and it's safe.|

2196
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,695
0,275 275,410 410,590 590,770 770,935
Then you proceed with running

2197
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:44,910
0,135 135,395 595,840 840,990 990,1215
the query. So that means

2198
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,820
0,1335 1335,1590 1590,1800 1800,2060 2620,2910
anyory has to be yes.

2199
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,455
0,165 165,440 790,1170 1170,1470 1470,1635
So statement, any update to

2200
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:50,235
0,105 105,510 510,645 645,720 720,780
the pageotory has to be

2201
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:51,260
0,105 105,210 210,455 475,750 750,1025
written. A disc? Absolutely yes,

2202
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,515
0,245 245,425 425,620 620,830 830,905
because otherwise you don't know

2203
00:53:52,515 --> 00:53:53,115
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,525 525,600
what. You don't know what

2204
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,000
0,90 90,335
you have.|

2205
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,220
0,400
Yes.|

2206
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:59,495
0,365 365,695 695,1060 1380,1780 3270,3665
This direct store, especially database

2207
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:00,815
0,315 315,510 510,690 690,995 1015,1320
file or a store, along

2208
00:54:00,815 --> 00:54:01,780
0,180 180,375 375,695
with other pages.|

2209
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,785
0,260 260,425 425,590 590,710 710,845
This question is, is this

2210
00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:03,895
0,255 255,480 480,585 585,795 795,1110
sort in a special database

2211
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:04,690
0,300 300,480 480,540 540,630 630,795
file or does it sort

2212
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,085
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,710 1180,1395
along with other pages? What

2213
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:07,500
0,45 45,105 105,315 315,695
do you might special?|

2214
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,080
0,260 260,520 810,1070 1070,1235 1235,1540
Just like a separate file,

2215
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,545
0,305 305,440 440,515 515,635 635,815
yeah, so in some sense

2216
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:11,450
0,195 195,345 345,450 450,600 600,905
will as a separate file,

2217
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,095
0,365 365,485 485,635 635,770 770,875
sql light will store this

2218
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,385
0,105 105,195 195,545 925,1185 1185,1290
in the header of the

2219
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,320
0,245
file.|

2220
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,460
0,380 730,1065 1065,1550
Typically stored separately.|

2221
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,580
0,400 720,965 965,1100 1100,1280 1280,1570
Yes, when you say that

2222
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,350
0,275 275,550 600,935 935,1265 1265,1660
the database uses multiple files,

2223
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,275
0,230 230,305 305,440 440,620 620,785
do you mean that a

2224
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:25,730
0,240 240,555 555,840 840,1140 1140,1455
single table uses multiple files?|

2225
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,480
0,400 450,740 740,950 950,1270
Uses like maybe one.|

2226
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,075
0,230 230,335 335,515 515,770 770,965
So his question is, when

2227
00:54:30,075 --> 00:54:30,990
0,135 135,345 345,525 525,690 690,915
I say a data system

2228
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,040
0,165 165,300 300,510 510,810 810,1050
could use multiple files, I

2229
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,065
0,260 610,930 930,1170 1170,1490 1750,2025
mean within one table, does

2230
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:35,355
0,180 180,360 360,555 555,875 955,1290
it contain multiple files or

2231
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,675
0,240 240,420 420,930 930,1125 1125,1320
within the databases, contain multiple

2232
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:37,820
0,335
files?|

2233
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,495
0,400 1440,1925 1925,2255 2255,2525 2525,2735
Anyone DB uses one file

2234
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,020
0,165 165,425
for all.|

2235
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,620
0,275 275,395 395,545 545,910 960,1280
Yeah. So duct DB uses

2236
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,400
0,195 195,360 360,495 495,585 585,780
one file, all the table,

2237
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,780
0,195 195,285 285,420 420,710 1090,1380
same as single light. But

2238
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,665
0,135 135,345 345,570 570,720 720,885
I mean we can pop

2239
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:47,850
0,120 120,240 240,615 615,905 925,1185
up and postgres and look

2240
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,555
0,105 105,195 195,330 330,570 570,705
in the data directory. There's

2241
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:49,095
0,45 45,135 135,240 240,390 390,540
a bunch of files in

2242
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:50,565
0,245 325,585 585,845 985,1305 1305,1470
there that have numbers in

2243
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:51,300
0,245
them.|

2244
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,425
0,105 105,350 430,720 720,915 915,1125
And there, various data files

2245
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:53,325
0,165 165,420 420,660 660,735 735,900
and sometimes therell be for

2246
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,360
0,360 360,555 555,765 765,870 870,1035
indexes. Sometimes there'll be four

2247
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,100
0,290
tables.|

2248
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,300
0,400 900,1190 1190,1400 1400,1580 1580,1760
And various systems do different

2249
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,030
0,320 460,780 780,1050 1050,1365 1365,1730
things and again, not to

2250
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,780
0,305 305,575 575,880 1050,1325 1325,1460
keep repeating myself. This is

2251
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,670
0,135 135,410 430,720 720,1190 1630,1890
the beauty of sql, I

2252
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,765
0,195 195,330 330,615 615,885 885,1095
don't know, don't care in

2253
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:05,815
0,120 120,330 330,705 705,930 930,1050
my sql queries, whether I

2254
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:06,640
0,105 105,270 270,540 540,735 735,825
have one file or a

2255
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,280
0,225 225,590 1390,1650 1650,1910 2320,2640
thousand files, the data can

2256
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,140
0,225 225,375 375,480 480,600 600,860
decide how to do that.

2257
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,230
0,260 260,395 395,560 560,695 695,800
It just knows how to

2258
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,120
0,120 120,255 255,450 450,615 615,890
run your query for you.|

2259
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,190
0,350 350,620 620,845 845,1055 1055,1280
So again, different data systems

2260
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,420
0,165 165,300 300,590
do different things.|

2261
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,225
0,165 165,270 270,375 375,540 540,705
How do you know when

2262
00:55:17,225 --> 00:55:17,820
0,150 150,330 330,555
you want to?|

2263
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,860
0,260 260,425 425,620 620,770 770,860
His question is, how do

2264
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,580
0,75 75,300 300,555 555,660 660,720
you know whether you want

2265
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,705
0,45 45,135 135,330 330,650 760,1125
to use multiple files for

2266
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:25,615
0,225 225,390 390,695 2305,2625 2625,2910
for one table? Again, it

2267
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,790
0,360 360,630 630,905 955,1355 1915,2175
depends. So like if we

2268
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,070
0,210 210,345 345,495 495,770 880,1280
won't talk about large large

2269
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,920
0,440 440,620 620,740 740,970 2010,2410
columns yet, but like see

2270
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,540
0,245 245,335 335,425 425,670
say you have a.|

2271
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,185
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,495 495,645
You have a table that

2272
00:55:34,185 --> 00:55:36,170
0,245 775,1080 1080,1365 1365,1650 1650,1985
has a blob field or

2273
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,980
0,290 290,485 485,790 1050,1385 1385,1730
a text field, and that's

2274
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,820
0,260 340,630 630,1220
like ten megabytes.|

2275
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,010
0,255 255,375 375,570 570,840 840,1190
You'd want to store that

2276
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,820
0,290 290,515 515,850 1380,1640 1640,1790
in separate pages, but maybe

2277
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,375
0,135 135,210 210,300 300,420 420,555
you want to store that

2278
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,710
0,485 505,1050 1050,1200 1200,1245 1245,1335
compressed because it's a bunch

2279
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,730
0,120 120,285 285,590 700,930 930,1020
of text data. So you

2280
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,095
0,105 105,225 225,500 730,1215 1215,1365
have the regular columns of

2281
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:48,390
0,75 75,405 405,630 630,975 975,1295
the integers and floats, whatever

2282
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,645
0,290 290,470 470,590 590,755 755,995
that stored in one file.

2283
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:51,040
0,180 180,420 420,780 780,1140 1140,1395
And then your large stuff

2284
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,990
0,135 135,330 330,435 435,630 630,950
is sorted in another file,

2285
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,265
0,400 750,1115 1115,1475 1475,1640 1640,1895
right? So that's one approach.

2286
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:55,090
0,165 165,240 240,360 360,600 600,825
But you can imagine also

2287
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,155
0,150 150,360 360,525 525,770 790,1065
too, maybe you just, you

2288
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:56,900
0,275
just.|

2289
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,875
0,305 305,470 470,635 635,815 815,935
You have some space in

2290
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:58,580
0,90 90,240 240,450 450,600 600,705
a single file at the

2291
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,240
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,480 480,660
top parts of the fixed

2292
00:55:59,240 --> 00:55:59,885
0,210 210,345 345,465 465,570 570,645
stuff, the bottom of the

2293
00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:01,020
0,240 240,485
verrel length.|

2294
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,340
0,270 270,560
It depends.|

2295
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,455
0,230 230,335 335,530 530,920 920,1085
I think my sequel up

2296
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:06,990
0,165 165,870 870,1080 1080,1245 1245,1535
to 5.6 used to store.|

2297
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,450
0,275 275,395 395,470 470,650 650,980
I think it was one

2298
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,380
0,345 345,555 555,690 690,980
file for all tables.|

2299
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,375
0,290 290,485 485,965 965,1240 1620,1865
Or all databases. And they

2300
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,590
0,255 255,605 625,870 870,1005 1005,1215
don't. No, it was one

2301
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,255
0,285 285,555 555,860 1240,1500 1500,1665
file per database and they

2302
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:16,750
0,150 150,210 210,285 285,390 390,495
split it up to be

2303
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,760
0,180 180,405 405,585 585,735 735,1010
one file, not per table.|

2304
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,430
0,275 275,470 470,680 680,860 860,1300
And separate files or indexes.|

2305
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,380
0,400
Okay.|

2306
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,160
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,730 780,1100
So now we know roughly

2307
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,885
0,320 430,830 1060,1320 1320,1515 1515,1725
at what the files look

2308
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,950
0,180 180,485 505,780 780,915 915,1065
like, or how the files

2309
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,625
0,165 165,315 315,465 465,585 585,675
are laid out and how

2310
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:31,285
0,90 90,225 225,375 375,510 510,660
we keep track of where

2311
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:33,805
0,195 195,515 1765,2220 2220,2400 2400,2520
they exist. So talk about

2312
00:56:33,805 --> 00:56:35,430
0,870 870,1080 1080,1245 1245,1365 1365,1625
what's's actually inside the pages

2313
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,620
0,400
themselves.|

2314
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,560
0,230 230,380 380,635 635,845 845,950
So every page is going

2315
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,120
0,75 75,240 240,420 420,800
to have a header.|

2316
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:41,305
0,165 165,255 255,480 480,750 750,990
That's going to tell you

2317
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:43,630
0,315 315,665 715,1115 1825,2085 2085,2325
something about what the data

2318
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,840
0,240 240,500
actually is.|

2319
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,445
0,400 600,890 890,1100 1100,1280 1280,1385
So a common thing would

2320
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,410
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,630 630,965
be like the page size

2321
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,210
0,305 305,470 470,635 635,890 890,1240
or like a check sum,

2322
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:50,920
0,335 335,500 500,575 575,725 725,1030
right? So if you crash

2323
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,330
0,305 305,485 485,680 680,860 860,1120
and come back or you

2324
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,005
0,410 410,530 530,740 740,1090 1350,1595
restart the system, or actually

2325
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:54,905
0,285 285,390 390,555 555,735 735,900
anytime you fetch something from

2326
00:56:54,905 --> 00:56:56,480
0,515 655,990 990,1275 1275,1395 1395,1575
disk, you compute a fast

2327
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,395
0,270 270,525 525,675 675,795 795,915
check some to make sure

2328
00:56:57,395 --> 00:56:58,630
0,105 105,225 225,420 420,705 705,1235
that the data isn't corrupted.|

2329
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,240
0,260
Um.|

2330
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,350
0,335 335,545 545,680 680,860 860,1070
Maybe keep track of the

2331
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,355
0,240 240,435 435,555 555,765 765,1005
version of the database system

2332
00:57:02,355 --> 00:57:03,735
0,240 240,450 450,675 675,1025 1105,1380
that actually created the the

2333
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,295
0,275 295,555 555,815 1195,1455 1455,1560
page. That way you put

2334
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:06,015
0,105 105,225 225,345 345,525 525,720
out a new version that

2335
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:07,650
0,165 165,785 1135,1380 1380,1485 1485,1635
breaks compatibility. You can have

2336
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,805
0,165 165,330 330,620 760,1035 1035,1155
some code that knows how

2337
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:09,710
0,180 180,405 405,525 525,630 630,905
to read the old data.|

2338
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:11,580
0,260 260,410 410,560 560,695 695,970
We all talk about transactions

2339
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,270
0,320 320,560 560,725 725,1070 1070,1250
until after the midterm, but

2340
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,440
0,225 225,450 450,705 705,990 990,1170
like, you can keep track

2341
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,075
0,150 150,410 820,1200 1200,1485 1485,1635
of like what thread or

2342
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,335
0,135 135,425 625,930 930,1095 1095,1260
what transaction wrote to what

2343
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:18,385
0,240 240,450 450,630 630,795 795,1050
data in this and whether

2344
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:19,620
0,375 375,525 525,735 735,960 960,1235
it's actually visible to whatever,

2345
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,400
0,275 275,485 485,725 725,970
whatever query you're running.|

2346
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,060
0,305 305,470 470,665 665,890 890,1360
If the data is compressed.|

2347
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,100
0,335 335,770 770,845 845,920 920,1010
Or encode it in a

2348
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,495
0,150 150,360 360,680 910,1245 1245,1395
certain way, which we'll discuss

2349
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,085
0,180 180,485 715,1005 1005,1110 1110,1590
next week. There'll be metadata

2350
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,420
0,240 240,635 715,975 975,1065 1065,1335
about how what the compression

2351
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,860
0,285 285,465 465,710
scheme actually is.|

2352
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,615
0,230 230,395 395,650 650,860 860,1025
To be information about what

2353
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,605
0,255 255,525 525,780 780,885 885,990
the the schema is or

2354
00:57:33,605 --> 00:57:35,225
0,90 90,195 195,455 1045,1410 1410,1620
what the table schema is,

2355
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:36,095
0,240 240,360 360,465 465,585 585,870
as we talk about Oracle

2356
00:57:36,095 --> 00:57:38,380
0,245 805,1205 1345,1710 1710,1935 1935,2285
does, sometimes there's additional statistics

2357
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,180
0,350 350,740 740,935 935,1100 1100,1360
about what's in the data

2358
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,140
0,400 900,1160 1160,1420 1650,1880 1880,1940
itself. So like for a

2359
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,420
0,180 180,525 525,855 855,990 990,1280
given column, what's the min,

2360
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,375
0,260 260,410 410,635 635,815 815,905
the min value and the

2361
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,770
0,180 180,515 835,1110 1110,1260 1260,1395
Max value? Because maybe I

2362
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,050
0,135 135,285 285,435 435,710 880,1280
just need to read that

2363
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,975
0,245 245,380 380,515 515,650 650,785
instead of actually reading the

2364
00:57:47,975 --> 00:57:48,820
0,180 180,360 360,465 465,585 585,845
data to figure out whether

2365
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,110
0,350 350,590 590,710 710,845 845,1090
and there's something I need.|

2366
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,425
0,350 350,575 575,710 710,830 830,935
Right. And again, as we

2367
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:54,525
0,150 150,360 360,825 825,1175 1585,2100
already discussed, Oracle is famously

2368
00:57:54,525 --> 00:57:56,070
0,225 225,575 685,975 975,1260 1260,1545
self contained, but not all

2369
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,640
0,225 225,420 420,680
systems do that.|

2370
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,955
0,245 245,350 350,545 545,740 740,965
So now, within the page

2371
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:03,055
0,365 1435,1665 1665,1740 1740,1860 1860,2100
itself, we need to decide

2372
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:03,865
0,270 270,465 465,600 600,675 675,810
how we actually want to

2373
00:58:03,865 --> 00:58:05,100
0,395
organize.|

2374
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,530
0,275 275,530 530,790 1110,1510 2190,2420
The twople data, right. So

2375
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:08,370
0,120 120,360 360,600 600,720 720,840
at this point in this

2376
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,705
0,290 700,990 990,1035 1035,1125 1125,1335
lecture, we're going to assume

2377
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:10,815
0,240 240,420 420,555 555,825 825,1110
that we're only storing twoles

2378
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,660
0,90 90,195 195,455 1285,1605 1605,1845
in our pages. We'll discuss

2379
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,145
0,360 360,620 970,1245 1245,1365 1365,1485
indexes later, and then we're

2380
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:14,790
0,30 30,150 150,345 345,495 495,645
going to assume that we're

2381
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,660
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,735 735,870
storing two balls in a

2382
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,320
0,225 225,660 660,1010
row oriented manner.|

2383
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,915
0,335 335,620 620,830 830,980 980,1205
Meaning like, if I have

2384
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:20,250
0,330 330,810 810,1065 1065,1155 1155,1335
five attributes I will have,

2385
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,260
0,240 240,390 390,495 495,600 600,1010
I will have a twople

2386
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,395
0,245 245,425 425,560 560,740 740,995
and I'll have those five

2387
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:23,745
0,285 285,855 855,1050 1050,1230 1230,1350
attributes contiguously before I see

2388
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:24,980
0,90 90,240 240,405 405,665
the next two bowl.|

2389
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,870
0,400 990,1265 1265,1475 1475,1565 1565,1700
Next week we'll see about

2390
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,040
0,240 240,555 555,795 795,945 945,1170
column stores. We store this

2391
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,075
0,270 270,570 570,825 825,930 930,1035
slightly different, but for our

2392
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:31,985
0,225 225,575 1555,1860 1860,2165 2545,2910
purposes here, we assume that's

2393
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:33,215
0,120 120,485 655,915 915,1080 1080,1230
row oriented and we'll break

2394
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:34,960
0,305 505,795 795,1085
this next week.|

2395
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,810
0,260 260,425 425,695 695,935 935,1270
So there's 300 approaches what,

2396
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,720
0,245 245,335 335,485 485,635 635,710
what it could actually be

2397
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,280
0,60 60,165 165,440 1180,1425 1425,1560
in our pages. So the

2398
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,450
0,285 285,600 600,870 870,1035 1035,1170
twople oriented storage where we're

2399
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,470
0,165 165,465 465,675 675,855 855,1020
only storing two pool and

2400
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,105
0,150 150,440 820,1200 1200,1470 1470,1635
the exact values that those

2401
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:44,650
0,255 255,545 1135,1395 1395,1455 1455,1545
twoils have, there be a

2402
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,730
0,195 195,570 570,780 780,960 960,1080
log structured approach where we

2403
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,860
0,150 150,345 345,750 750,870 870,1130
just store deltas of what

2404
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,270
0,380 380,635 635,770 770,980 980,1330
changed since the last time

2405
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,760
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,785 785,1180
last time these two updated.|

2406
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,480
0,275 275,550 600,845 845,1090 1230,1490
And that should be in

2407
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,145
0,225 225,590 970,1245 1245,1440 1440,1665
index, organized in index, organized

2408
00:58:55,145 --> 00:58:56,560
0,180 180,300 300,545
store to be.|

2409
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,265
0,290 290,425 425,545 545,725 725,965
It could be like a

2410
00:58:58,265 --> 00:59:00,365
0,285 285,635 1195,1595 1675,1950 1950,2100
tree structure, where in the

2411
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:01,385
0,225 225,510 510,705 705,840 840,1020
leaf nodes I'm actually storing

2412
00:59:01,385 --> 00:59:02,780
0,135 135,375 375,755
the data itself.|

2413
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,220
0,365 365,815 815,995 995,1205 1205,1310
So today's lecture, we're only

2414
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,000
0,120 120,195 195,360 360,600 600,780
going to talk about the

2415
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,850
0,165 165,470 1030,1290 1290,1500 1500,1850
first one, two point storage,

2416
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,090
0,245 245,395 395,605 605,770 770,920
and then next week we'll

2417
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,320
0,150 150,470 760,1020 1020,1110 1110,1230
talk about the two other

2418
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,980
0,290
approaches.|

2419
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,385
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,650 650,755
All right, so let's think

2420
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:14,030
0,195 195,375 375,450 450,540 540,645
about how do we actually

2421
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:14,630
0,60 60,150 150,285 285,510 510,600
want to store twoils in

2422
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,780
0,90 90,350
our pages?|

2423
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:16,805
0,335 335,500 500,665 665,770 770,875
Right. So let's say we

2424
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:17,705
0,75 75,165 165,345 345,585 585,900
have a really simple approach

2425
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:19,580
0,395 955,1215 1215,1365 1365,1575 1575,1875
where in our page header,

2426
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,255
0,105 105,210 210,360 360,540 540,675
we just keep track of

2427
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:20,780
0,90 90,195 195,300 300,405 405,525
the number of two pool

2428
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,350
0,105 105,210 210,470 1330,1730 2170,2570
that we have, right? And

2429
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,995
0,575 575,710 710,815 815,905 905,1175
anytime we want to insert

2430
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,320
0,90 90,225 225,515
a new two.|

2431
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,175
0,195 195,300 300,585 585,750 750,855
We just append to the

2432
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,160
0,245
end.|

2433
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,020
0,400 780,1010 1010,1070 1070,1220 1220,1400
Right, so we can assume

2434
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,475
0,135 135,420 420,585 585,890 1240,1455
our data fixed length. So

2435
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:32,000
0,45 45,150 150,285 285,405 405,525
if I want to sort

2436
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,750
0,150 150,315 315,480 480,630 630,750
new two po, I just

2437
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,700
0,165 165,330 330,450 450,555 555,950
go look at the header,

2438
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:34,810
0,260 260,365 365,530 530,725 725,1000
see the number two pool,

2439
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,700
0,530 530,725 725,1030 1230,1490 1490,1640
multiply that by the size

2440
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,660
0,120 120,210 210,345 345,620 700,960
of the two pool and

2441
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,650
0,150 150,345 345,510 510,750 750,990
that tells me where offset

2442
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,205
0,135 135,255 255,345 345,450 450,555
I want to write the

2443
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,140
0,245
page.|

2444
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:44,860
0,60 60,305
What's wrong?|

2445
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,220
0,670 720,1010 1010,1160 1160,1420
Laterfly just kill it.|

2446
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,540
0,350 350,700 810,1055 1055,1205 1205,1510
Is anybody keep that alive?

2447
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,540
0,230 230,460 600,1270 1380,2140
We have lanfly infestation.|

2448
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,280
0,260 260,520 1290,1595 1595,1900
All right, right. So.|

2449
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,470
0,245 245,350 350,470 470,650 650,800
Is this a good idea

2450
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,280
0,60 60,120 120,300 300,650
or a bad idea?|

2451
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,330
0,260 260,440 440,665 665,875 875,1010
I said straw man, so

2452
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,245
0,195 195,375 375,495 495,675 675,915
it's obviously a bad idea.

2453
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:11,785
0,150 150,240 240,315 315,375 375,540
Why is it a bad

2454
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:12,700
0,335
idea?|

2455
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,340
0,400 510,910 1080,1400 1400,1700 1700,2080
Tu then it just throw

2456
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,160
0,275 275,440 440,710
everything out of.|

2457
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,510
0,305 305,440 440,515 515,710 710,980
Right, so if I deleted

2458
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:19,700
0,105 105,210 210,470 490,840 840,1190
two, plus I delete two,

2459
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,930
0,400 1020,1280 1280,1520 1520,1670 1670,1760
two, it throws everything out

2460
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:22,960
0,45 45,260
of order.|

2461
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,285
0,305 305,485 485,635 635,910 1710,1955
Right. Because now I what

2462
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:25,795
0,105 105,225 225,330 330,405 405,510
I want to be able

2463
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:28,135
0,120 120,345 345,725 1825,2235 2235,2340
to do is insert a

2464
01:00:28,135 --> 01:00:29,095
0,360 360,585 585,705 705,870 870,960
newu and I won't put

2465
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:29,650
0,105 105,195 195,315 315,465 465,555
at the end. I want

2466
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,475
0,60 60,180 180,375 375,570 570,825
to use this spot here,

2467
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:31,560
0,365
right?|

2468
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,030
0,395 395,635 635,785 785,1025 1025,1220
So, you know, number two

2469
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,230
0,105 105,255 255,560 760,1035 1035,1200
plus is enough. Maybe I

2470
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,850
0,195 195,375 375,650 1060,1395 1395,1620
keep track of where things

2471
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,005
0,240 240,540 540,810 810,1020 1020,1155
are located, second side, where

2472
01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:38,210
0,105 105,195 195,255 255,485 805,1205
to put them in, right?|

2473
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,335
0,400 420,650 650,875 875,1265 1265,1505
But, you know, it's going

2474
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:41,270
0,225 225,345 390,465 465,630 630,935
beyond what I'm showing here.|

2475
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,080
0,90 90,300 300,540 540,830
What's another obvious problem?|

2476
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,780
0,225 225,315 315,560 2320,2565 2565,2700
One of the he said

2477
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,010
0,290 310,570 570,645 645,860 970,1230
what one of the too

2478
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:48,490
0,120 120,240 240,345 345,420 420,480
big to start on the

2479
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,620
0,230 910,1310 1390,1740 1740,1980 1980,2130
page? Yes, but also what

2480
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,700
0,120 120,435 435,675 675,870 870,1080
if they're not the fixed

2481
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,520
0,320 730,1035 1035,1275 1275,1515 1515,1820
length, which most data is,

2482
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,900
0,275 275,485 485,710 710,950 950,1300
is not fixed length, right?|

2483
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,595
0,275 275,545 545,710 710,800 800,965
Email addresses aren't the same

2484
01:00:56,595 --> 01:00:59,205
0,305 1915,2145 2145,2385 2385,2520 2520,2610
size. Android IDs aren't the

2485
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:00,140
0,180 180,375 375,480 480,630 630,935
same, always the same size.

2486
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:01,320
0,245 245,365 365,470 470,575 575,710
Now I can just sort

2487
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,160
0,105 105,255 255,495 495,720 720,840
as a chart type, but

2488
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,835
0,75 75,165 165,315 315,510 510,675
what does that do that

2489
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:04,125
0,135 135,605 685,975 975,1140 1140,1290
pre allocates the space I

2490
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,170
0,275 745,1050 1050,1200 1200,1445 1645,2045
need? And you know, if

2491
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,030
0,260 260,520 780,1085 1085,1325 1325,1660
the largest email address is

2492
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,630
0,290 290,470 470,1060 1080,1325 1325,1400
is one kilobyte then I

2493
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,695
0,75 75,210 210,375 375,540 540,1065
have to store one kilobyte

2494
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:11,580
0,135 135,270 270,510 510,720 720,885
for every single email address,

2495
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,300
0,180 180,330 330,510 510,615 615,720
even though it's not going

2496
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,130
0,60 60,150 150,330 330,540 540,830
to be using that space.|

2497
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,465
0,400 810,1055 1055,1190 1190,1385 1385,1565
Right then, his comment is,

2498
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:16,155
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,480 480,690
well, what if the table

2499
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:18,180
0,425 1225,1500 1500,1695 1695,1950 1950,2025
can the table can't fit

2500
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,470
0,60 60,165 165,440 970,1215 1215,1290
in this page? How do

2501
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,140
0,90 90,255 255,480 480,830
I spam multiple pages?|

2502
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,175
0,180 180,375 375,570 570,765 765,1035
We discuss that next week,

2503
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:23,765
0,365 865,1200 1200,1380 1380,1470 1470,1590
but this also would not

2504
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:24,640
0,275
work.|

2505
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,620
0,290
Right.|

2506
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,910
0,290 290,580 630,875 875,980 980,1100
So clearly, you know, this

2507
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:27,585
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,570 570,675
is not enough for us.

2508
01:01:27,585 --> 01:01:28,725
0,135 135,345 345,615 615,1020 1020,1140
We need additional meta to

2509
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:31,590
0,135 135,330 330,635 2395,2685 2685,2865
keep track of, keep track

2510
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,480
0,290 790,1190 1240,1605 1605,1800 1800,1890
of how we going to

2511
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,890
0,120 120,380 580,915 915,1200 1200,1410
store this. Another problem too

2512
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,395
0,255 255,650 760,1125 1125,1490 2200,2505
is again, if four, if

2513
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:38,970
0,240 240,525 525,720 720,1055 1285,1575
four couldn't go here, right,

2514
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,890
0,165 165,390 390,525 525,660 660,920
I couldn't fill the gap.|

2515
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,015
0,400 510,860 860,1070 1070,1235 1235,1505
Ah, where? When I deleted

2516
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,185
0,275 355,645 645,840 840,1035 1035,1170
two? If four needs to

2517
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:45,150
0,180 180,515 1225,1470 1470,1620 1620,1965
go here then I'm wasting

2518
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,395
0,320 670,915 915,1005 1005,1125 1125,1245
space. But if I want

2519
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:47,510
0,75 75,240 240,570 570,840 840,1115
to, maybe move three up.|

2520
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,695
0,290 290,580 660,905 905,1010 1010,1145
But now I have to

2521
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,340
0,165 165,300 300,420 420,525 525,645
tell the rest of the

2522
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,680
0,255 255,495 495,675 675,960 960,1340
system that I moved three.|

2523
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,510
0,350 350,545 545,635 635,755 755,890
Right, because I have told

2524
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,320
0,120 120,255 255,450 450,615 615,810
you how I'm pointing to

2525
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,480
0,195 195,360 360,510 510,780 780,1160
three how I find three.|

2526
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:57,935
0,305 305,485 485,695 695,770 770,845
But assuming it's going to

2527
01:01:57,935 --> 01:01:59,810
0,165 165,390 390,675 675,1055 1555,1875
be like some offset within

2528
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:00,995
0,210 210,500 730,975 975,1080 1080,1185
this page, but now if

2529
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:02,480
0,165 165,375 375,755
I'm moving three.|

2530
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,420
0,365 365,590 590,695 695,770 770,830
Then then I have to

2531
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,545
0,135 135,330 330,540 540,840 840,1125
go update every possible index.

2532
01:02:04,545 --> 01:02:05,475
0,195 195,345 345,525 525,765 765,930
That is maybe pointing to

2533
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:06,280
0,245
it.|

2534
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:06,745
0,105 105,195 195,255 255,285 285,375
And that's going to be

2535
01:02:06,745 --> 01:02:07,980
0,210 210,545
super expensive.|

2536
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,450
0,400 450,710 710,890 890,1175 1175,1540
So the most common approach

2537
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,140
0,275 275,455 455,635 635,910 1290,1580
to handle this problem is

2538
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,195
0,240 240,645 645,920 1630,1920 1920,2055
called slotted pages. And what

2539
01:02:15,195 --> 01:02:16,680
0,195 195,435 435,705 705,1175 1255,1485
I'll describe here isn't, you

2540
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,265
0,105 105,330 330,390 390,435 435,585
know, isn't going to be

2541
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:18,420
0,255 255,450 450,645 645,915 915,1155
exactly how every system does

2542
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,575
0,290 490,735 735,840 840,960 960,1155
this, but at a high

2543
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:20,505
0,240 240,420 420,555 555,750 750,930
level, this is what everyone

2544
01:02:20,505 --> 01:02:21,450
0,120 120,300 300,585 585,855 855,945
is doing. If you're a

2545
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,955
0,150 150,420 420,630 630,950 2080,2505
row oriented database system that's

2546
01:02:23,955 --> 01:02:25,580
0,270 270,555 555,930 930,1245 1245,1625
using two oriented pages, so

2547
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,260
0,320 320,575 575,1090
not log structured.|

2548
01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:28,130
0,90 90,150 150,330 330,555 555,705
Then they're doing something that

2549
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,420
0,120 120,270 270,560
looks like this.|

2550
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,600
0,245 245,380 380,425 425,485 485,730
So we're going to have,

2551
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,605
0,290 290,365 365,470 470,740 740,1025
we'll have a header that

2552
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:33,580
0,270 270,405 405,480 480,695 745,975
keeps track of all the

2553
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,470
0,255 255,345 345,450 450,600 600,890
metadat. We talked about four,

2554
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,120
0,215 215,350 350,635 635,860 860,1270
but then after the header,

2555
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:38,040
0,290 290,425 425,635 635,920 920,1270
we'll have this slot array.|

2556
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,420
0,290 400,800
Where the?|

2557
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,040
0,290 290,580 660,1025 1025,1250 1250,1400
At every position in that

2558
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,450
0,240 240,560 850,1125 1125,1245 1245,1410
slot, array is going to

2559
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,780
0,270 270,620 1270,1635 1635,2180 3070,3330
point to some twople in

2560
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,060
0,150 150,440
our page.|

2561
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,735
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,555 555,675
And the two balls will

2562
01:02:48,735 --> 01:02:49,575
0,120 120,300 300,465 465,600 600,840
be starting at the bottom

2563
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:50,265
0,225 225,330 330,465 465,600 600,690
at the end of the

2564
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:51,260
0,245
page.|

2565
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,840
0,380 380,760 780,1040 1040,1145 1145,1310
Right. So at the bottom

2566
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,500
0,165 165,270 270,390 390,510 510,660
will have all the fixed

2567
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,990
0,165 165,440 640,960 960,1230 1230,1490
length and length ta data.

2568
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,880
0,245 245,485 485,800 800,1040 1040,1360
For now assume that that

2569
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,600
0,320 320,530 530,725 725,1030 1290,1610
everything is put together, right?

2570
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,030
0,165 165,315 315,620 730,1005 1005,1430
So meaning like there isn't,

2571
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:00,820
0,275 275,395 395,470 470,560 560,710
if you have a really

2572
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,035
0,180 180,450 450,675 675,960 960,1215
large value, it isn't stored

2573
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:04,285
0,255 255,555 555,875 1135,1535 1915,2250
in separate page. The entire

2574
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:04,960
0,210 210,315 315,375 375,450 450,675
table has to be stored

2575
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,100
0,180 180,315 315,590
inside this page.|

2576
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,385
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,770 770,965
And so the slot array

2577
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:08,940
0,150 150,315 315,435 435,480 480,555
is just going to be

2578
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,295
0,290 400,690 690,885 885,1400 2080,2355
storing fixed length offsets to

2579
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:12,750
0,275 505,765 765,960 960,1185 1185,1455
where to find the starting

2580
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,120
0,375 375,770 940,1275 1275,1730
location of individual tubes.|

2581
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,005
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,635 635,815
And maybe you could also

2582
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:17,160
0,165 165,455 595,900 900,1050 1050,1155
store the size and the

2583
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,050
0,195 195,240 240,315 315,570 570,890
tple and the header if

2584
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,520
0,260 260,440 440,760
you wanted to.|

2585
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,940
0,400
Right.|

2586
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,045
0,245 245,365 455,515 515,590 590,665
So now what's going to

2587
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:23,380
0,195 195,545 685,1035 1035,1230 1230,1335
happen is as we need

2588
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,620
0,180 180,500
to update.|

2589
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,315
0,400 540,940 1080,1355 1355,1630 1950,2225
The the the table and

2590
01:03:27,315 --> 01:03:29,385
0,180 180,390 390,695 1255,1655 1795,2070
add new pages. Sorry, add

2591
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:30,500
0,150 150,525 525,750 750,855 855,1115
new tubes inside the page.

2592
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,890
0,275 275,560 560,785 785,920 920,1010
The slot array is going

2593
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,225
0,105 105,330 330,680 760,1080 1080,1335
to grow from the beginning

2594
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,560
0,180 180,285 285,545
to the end.|

2595
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,715
0,255 255,450 450,690 690,900 900,1155
And then all our tubal

2596
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:36,510
0,180 180,375 375,480 480,600 600,795
data is going to grow

2597
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,890
0,240 240,560 760,1095 1095,1260 1260,1380
from the end to the

2598
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,000
0,290
beginning.|

2599
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:40,365
0,275 275,440 440,635 635,815 815,935
And any single time I

2600
01:03:40,365 --> 01:03:41,780
0,120 120,225 225,420 420,785 1015,1415
add a new entry into

2601
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,760
0,290 290,515 515,820 1110,1385 1385,1780
my slot array, new til,

2602
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,935
0,400 780,1180 2640,2900 2900,3005 3005,3155
I put update the slot

2603
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:47,775
0,135 135,255 255,375 375,615 615,840
array to tell me where

2604
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:48,780
0,90 90,195 195,330 330,605
to go find it.|

2605
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,900
0,400
Right.|

2606
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,525
0,230 230,335 335,440 440,515 515,605
So now if I go

2607
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:52,065
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,420 420,540
back to the problem I

2608
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:52,875
0,90 90,300 300,495 495,615 615,810
had before where I say

2609
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,970
0,210 210,480 480,690 690,1025 2695,3095
I deleted two, three, well,

2610
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,215
0,275 275,440 440,725 725,1120 1560,1895
this is fine because I

2611
01:03:58,215 --> 01:03:59,265
0,345 345,480 480,645 645,855 855,1050
didn't move any other two

2612
01:03:59,265 --> 01:04:00,340
0,275
pool.|

2613
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,140
0,240 240,495 495,735 735,1040 1510,1800
The slot array, still for

2614
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,180
0,225 225,450 450,645 645,795 795,1040
four, still points to it,

2615
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,380
0,230 230,305 305,515 515,695 695,970
so I don't tell any

2616
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,290
0,290 290,425 425,500 500,590 590,800
other part of the system

2617
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,720
0,180 180,285 285,480 480,800
that I moved for.|

2618
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,610
0,260 640,915 915,1190 1540,1785 1785,1890
Right. But even, you know,

2619
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,375
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,600 600,765
if I now wanted to

2620
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,240
0,390 390,665 715,1050 1050,1215 1215,1865
reclaim this space that ive

2621
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,140
0,245 245,350 350,440 440,515 515,590
three used to be and

2622
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,415
0,150 150,620 760,1020 1020,1155 1155,1275
I deleted, if I want

2623
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:15,630
0,150 150,455 475,810 810,1035 1035,1215
to slide three or four

2624
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,550
0,290 580,915 915,1250 1330,1710 1710,1920
over to, to take, you

2625
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,010
0,135 135,480 480,800 1960,2280 2280,2460
know, compact it, all they

2626
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,865
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,585 585,855
need to do now is

2627
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:21,930
0,255 255,465 465,765 765,945 945,1065
update the slaughter array to

2628
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,760
0,120 120,225 225,300 300,480 480,830
point to the new offset.|

2629
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,520
0,245 245,335 335,515 515,695 695,940
Which is easy to do.|

2630
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,515
0,230 230,365 365,545 545,860 860,1085
I don't have to. Again,

2631
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:29,325
0,210 210,420 420,585 585,690 690,810
relational model says they don't

2632
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:30,225
0,60 60,120 120,195 195,455 625,900
have to do this. Some,

2633
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:31,290
0,165 165,390 390,660 660,855 855,1065
some systems do, some systems

2634
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,040
0,300 300,435 435,540 540,660 660,750
don't. We'll see this in

2635
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,820
0,90 90,350 670,1070
a second, right?|

2636
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,800
0,275 275,395 395,500 500,650 650,940
And this is all fine.|

2637
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,100
0,245 245,335 335,410 410,515 515,880
So this is what sql

2638
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,940
0,395 395,500 500,785 785,965 965,1220
actuallyt know, sql does this,

2639
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,540
0,270 270,435 435,765 765,1040 2140,2600
but what postgres does, sql,

2640
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,175
0,365 365,485 485,2045 2045,2210 2210,2375
sql server, doesotted pages is

2641
01:04:45,175 --> 01:04:45,970
0,60 60,165 165,375 375,615 615,795
the most common approach. This

2642
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:47,280
0,105 105,270 270,435 435,680
is what everyone does.|

2643
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,840
0,400
EM.|

2644
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,040
0,400
Yes.|

2645
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,680
0,260 260,520 660,905 905,1025 1025,1480
This question, can I reuse

2646
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,410
0,335 335,620 620,1000 3210,3455 3455,3590
slot position three? But I

2647
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,415
0,285 285,435 435,615 615,810 810,1005
don't have to put that

2648
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:03,915
0,210 210,375 375,540 540,845 1225,1500
in front of four, right?

2649
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:04,670
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,435 435,755
I can put it anywhere.|

2650
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,620
0,275 275,550
Other questions?|

2651
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,980
0,400
Yes.|

2652
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,480
0,420 420,645 645,975 975,1230 1230,1520
Wasting a small amount of.|

2653
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,635
0,305 305,425 425,640 690,1055 1055,1265
Yeah, so her statement, her

2654
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:20,550
0,150 150,420 420,720 720,795 795,915
question is, wouldn't this be

2655
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,605
0,375 375,710 940,1305 1305,1620 1620,2055
wasting space if the twoils

2656
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:24,710
0,335 355,720 720,1085 1375,1740 1740,2105
are variable length? Yeah, so

2657
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,000
0,400
the.|

2658
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,490
0,380 380,665 665,950 950,1085 1085,1360
Again, my tubils are growing

2659
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,040
0,305 305,610 1170,1520 1520,1730 1730,1990
from the, from, from the

2660
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,115
0,365 365,470 470,575 575,710 710,845
twoa. Data is going from

2661
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:31,930
0,105 105,270 270,405 405,525 525,815
the end to the beginning.

2662
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,380
0,440 440,515 515,620 620,710 710,800
Sloty is going from the

2663
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,460
0,105 105,180 180,255 255,500 760,1080
beginning to the end. At

2664
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,150
0,255 255,465 465,615 615,645 645,690
some point, I'm going to

2665
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:35,855
0,90 90,195 195,330 330,540 540,705
run out of space and

2666
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:36,380
0,90 90,180 180,255 255,360 360,525
there might be a little

2667
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,380
0,150 150,410 760,1005 1005,1250 1600,2000
bit of, you know, little

2668
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,680
0,275 275,380 380,455 455,700 780,1010
space in the middle that

2669
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,385
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,510 510,705
I can't use for anything.

2670
01:05:40,385 --> 01:05:41,920
0,105 105,210 210,585 585,905
Is that wasted? Yes.|

2671
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,865
0,275 275,470 470,740 740,995 995,1205
But the advantage we get

2672
01:05:43,865 --> 01:05:46,175
0,195 195,420 420,750 750,1145 2035,2310
of not having to update

2673
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,790
0,210 210,545 1105,1710 1710,2070 2070,2615
other things anytime we shuffle

2674
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,290
0,260 260,425 425,575 575,770 770,1090
the order, the slot array

2675
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,580
0,400 540,830 830,1025 1025,1330
is worth that cost.|

2676
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:59,620
0,400
Okay.|

2677
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,965
0,245 245,490 1410,1700 1700,1865 1865,1955
So now, assuming we sort

2678
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:02,780
0,75 75,195 195,330 330,570 570,815
of thinking the slotted pages.|

2679
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,205
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,605 605,755
Now we need a way

2680
01:06:05,205 --> 01:06:07,680
0,305 325,725 1255,1515 1515,1865
to identify two poles.|

2681
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,200
0,305 305,575 575,815 815,905 905,1010
And this this one, we're

2682
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,550
0,45 45,105 105,350 970,1215 1215,1350
going to use the notion

2683
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,215
0,135 135,255 255,435 435,740 1360,1665
of a record ID. Different

2684
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:14,505
0,210 210,515 745,1020 1020,1155 1155,1290
data systems may call this

2685
01:06:14,505 --> 01:06:15,510
0,135 135,270 270,545 625,885 885,1005
the row ID or the

2686
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,085
0,150 150,440 1090,1335 1335,1425 1425,1575
row number, but a high

2687
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:17,985
0,305 385,630 630,720 720,795 795,900
level, the way to think

2688
01:06:17,985 --> 01:06:19,200
0,120 120,365 385,750 750,975 975,1215
about it. It is a

2689
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,420
0,285 285,435 435,1040 1120,1520
way to uniquely identify.|

2690
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,015
0,270 270,885 885,1370 2110,2430 2430,2595
Some logical til based on

2691
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:26,115
0,165 165,485 775,1175 1705,1980 1980,2100
its physical location inside of

2692
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:26,880
0,120 120,375 375,600 600,675 675,765
a file inside of a

2693
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,880
0,260
page.|

2694
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:28,970
0,260 260,440 440,605 605,755 755,830
And it's typically going to

2695
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:30,020
0,60 60,165 165,440 520,840 840,1050
be a combination of a

2696
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,450
0,225 225,510 510,705 705,950 1030,1430
file number, an ID number,

2697
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,620
0,305 305,545 545,880
the page number.|

2698
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,520
0,120 120,255 255,420 420,675 675,900
And then the slot number

2699
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,825
0,210 210,690 690,900 900,1125 1125,1305
that corresponds where they exist

2700
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,260
0,105 105,240 240,510 510,845
in that slot array.|

2701
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,265
0,245 245,395 395,605 605,770 770,875
So that when you want

2702
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:39,300
0,90 90,195 195,330 330,780 780,1035
to do a lookup to

2703
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,470
0,165 165,360 360,650 760,1020 1020,1170
say I need, I need

2704
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:41,655
0,180 180,360 360,650 790,1065 1065,1185
this two pool. If you

2705
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,080
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,725 1195,1425
have the record ID, you

2706
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,635
0,75 75,195 195,330 330,435 435,555
would then look in the

2707
01:06:43,635 --> 01:06:44,400
0,210 210,510 510,555 555,645 645,765
page directory and to figure

2708
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,500
0,120 120,300 300,555 555,795 795,1100
out what page has it,

2709
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,550
0,320 320,545 545,770 770,1090 1350,1730
go grab that page. Then

2710
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:48,600
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,840 840,1050
use the slot number inside

2711
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,560
0,135 135,375 375,585 585,705 705,960
the slot to figure out

2712
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,955
0,380 610,840 840,1005 1005,1230 1230,1395
where you know what what

2713
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:51,915
0,180 180,390 390,555 555,690 690,960
off site inside that page

2714
01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:52,785
0,270 270,405 405,555 555,720 720,870
has the data you're looking

2715
01:06:52,785 --> 01:06:53,520
0,335
for.|

2716
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,775
0,245 245,425 425,935 935,1100 1100,1265
So most databases will not

2717
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:56,690
0,165 165,300 300,465 465,705 705,915
store this record ID. This

2718
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,270
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,1035 1035,1580
is something that's synthesized, materialize,

2719
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,450
0,365 365,620 620,755 755,845 845,1010
again, based on the page

2720
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,060
0,500 580,840 840,990 990,1245 1245,1610
directory you know of, of

2721
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:03,440
0,275 275,500 500,725 725,860 860,1010
or how how you keep

2722
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,250
0,165 165,375 375,555 555,660 660,810
track of how to find

2723
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,735
0,290 400,720 720,930 930,1215 1215,1485
things meaning like within the

2724
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:06,980
0,240 240,495 495,825 825,1095 1095,1245
tubil date itself, I'm not

2725
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,600
0,285 285,465 465,645 645,950
storing this record ID.|

2726
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,970
0,410 410,575 575,815 815,1040 1040,1330
Sql light does store this

2727
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,650
0,260 260,365 365,545 545,830 830,1180
as a separate column that

2728
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,725
0,410 410,620 620,770 770,905 905,1055
you're not supposed to see,

2729
01:07:12,725 --> 01:07:13,355
0,120 120,225 225,360 360,510 510,630
but you can get to

2730
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:14,690
0,245 625,885 885,1005 1005,1170 1170,1335
it. And the way they

2731
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,500
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,705 705,810
do, the reason why they

2732
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,265
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,600 600,765
do this is because this

2733
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,320
0,150 150,345 345,555 555,720 720,1055
is how they're going to.|

2734
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,085
0,260 260,350 350,410 410,470 470,605
These are going to use

2735
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:19,985
0,225 225,435 435,600 600,750 750,900
this, use this as the

2736
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:20,915
0,275 295,570 570,690 690,825 825,930
primary key to allow them

2737
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:23,555
0,215 235,635 1135,1470 1470,1925 2425,2640
to identify individual twoles. So

2738
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:24,440
0,75 75,180 180,425 475,765 765,885
if like I, we, we

2739
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,370
0,150 150,225 225,405 405,630 630,930
haven't talked about secondary indexes,

2740
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:25,955
0,90 90,150 150,330 330,525 525,585
but I have, if I

2741
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:26,855
0,60 60,225 225,495 495,810 810,900
have an index, that's not

2742
01:07:26,855 --> 01:07:28,460
0,105 105,315 315,555 555,845
the primary key index.|

2743
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,590
0,400 660,995 995,1330 1350,1595 1595,1840
My, my value when I,

2744
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,665
0,365 365,590 590,695 695,815 815,1055
when I do my lookup

2745
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:32,670
0,90 90,210 210,485 625,900 900,1005
on a key is going

2746
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,330
0,60 60,150 150,285 285,435 435,660
to be that row ID

2747
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,425
0,210 210,345 345,555 555,870 870,1095
which I then use in

2748
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,520
0,120 120,390 390,690 690,855 855,1095
the primary key row ID

2749
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,330
0,270 270,420 420,555 555,675 675,810
index to find the data

2750
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,240
0,150 150,410
I need.|

2751
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,110
0,320 320,560 560,740 740,905 905,1210
Different systems do different things.|

2752
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,745
0,275 275,440 440,680 680,890 890,1025
So, the size of this

2753
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:43,500
0,150 150,255 255,360 360,635 1495,1755
is going to vary based

2754
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,985
0,135 135,300 300,590 850,1125 1125,1485
on implementation implementation. So postgres

2755
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:45,590
0,120 120,180 180,210 210,315 315,605
is going to be six,

2756
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,895
0,305 305,790 1380,1880 1880,1985 1985,2075
six bytes, sqltes going be

2757
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:48,950
0,135 135,360 360,465 465,795 795,1055
eight bytes or 64 bits.

2758
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,880
0,380 380,545 545,710 710,815 815,950
Sql server has an eight

2759
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,780
0,195 195,330 330,465 465,570 570,900
byte one and then Oracle

2760
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,765
0,260 1120,1395 1395,1560 1560,1970 2680,2985
has a ten byte record

2761
01:07:54,765 --> 01:07:55,620
0,305
ID.|

2762
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,310
0,320 320,500 500,695 695,935 935,1160
Again, you can see this

2763
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,260
0,225 225,360 360,435 435,615 615,950
directly in the database system

2764
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,530
0,230 230,290 290,350 350,425 425,530
so we can do a

2765
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,490
0,135 135,315 315,480 480,720 720,960
quick demo just to show

2766
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:02,200
0,105 105,210 210,470
you all this.|

2767
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:05,810
0,275 275,440 440,590 590,770 770,920
So you're not supposed to

2768
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:06,890
0,225 225,420 420,525 525,735 735,1080
use this in your application,

2769
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,285
0,380 640,900 900,1065 1065,1245 1245,1395
right? So even though this

2770
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:11,200
0,135 135,690 690,1085 1195,1595
would uniquely identify a.|

2771
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,015
0,290 290,730 1020,1385 1580,1670 1670,1805
A to, again, it's the

2772
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:14,840
0,275 355,690 690,900 900,1175
physical location of it.|

2773
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,670
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,910 1440,1790
And it could change meaning,

2774
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,500
0,345 345,660 660,980 1300,1710 1710,1830
like if I insert a

2775
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,895
0,410 820,1080 1080,1200 1200,1305 1305,1395
til and I get a

2776
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,680
0,165 165,485
record ID.|

2777
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,990
0,400 450,830 830,1210 1290,1595 1595,2090
If my application then references

2778
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,355
0,260 580,855 855,1050 1050,1215 1215,1365
it, the problem could be

2779
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,525
0,255 255,480 480,615 615,750 750,1170
like I could run compaction

2780
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:27,800
0,225 225,525 525,750 750,990 990,1275
or garbage collection. In postgres

2781
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,230
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,800 1030,1430
it's called the vacuum where

2782
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,860
0,275 275,410 410,950 950,1130 1130,1340
I could reorganize that page

2783
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,745
0,195 195,375 375,555 555,705 705,885
where maybe now the slot

2784
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:32,990
0,195 195,515 685,945 945,1080 1080,1245
number changes or the page

2785
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:33,995
0,195 195,450 450,660 660,840 840,1005
number changes. And now the

2786
01:08:33,995 --> 01:08:34,760
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,525 525,765
thing I'm looking for isn't

2787
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,080
0,210 210,560 760,1035 1035,1185 1185,1320
there anymore. So again, this

2788
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,385
0,105 105,240 240,530 880,1170 1170,1305
is a physical aspect of

2789
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:38,225
0,90 90,270 270,510 510,675 675,840
the database system that we're

2790
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:39,280
0,105 105,240 240,330 330,575 655,1055
not supposed to really use

2791
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,705
0,245 245,440 440,790 1050,1450 1710,2135
in our application, but it's

2792
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:43,055
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,1025 1105,1350
exposed to us because if

2793
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:43,790
0,90 90,210 210,345 345,660 660,735
we need to administer and

2794
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,185
0,210 210,465 465,740 1030,1275 1275,1395
maintain these systems, we need

2795
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:46,280
0,120 120,365 535,795 795,900 900,1095
to know where the data

2796
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,220
0,195 195,440
actually is.|

2797
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,915
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,605 605,755
So let me log in

2798
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:53,640
0,210 210,545
quickly. Sorry.|

2799
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,760
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,880
We need to reconnect.|

2800
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:05,360
0,245 245,380 380,485 485,545 545,650
All right, so I do

2801
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,700
0,285 285,560
postgres first.|

2802
01:09:08,135 --> 01:09:08,810
0,150 150,210 210,285 285,465 465,675
So we're going to create

2803
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,850
0,135 135,300 300,495 495,720 720,1040
a really simple table r.|

2804
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,120
0,260 260,410 410,700 720,995 995,1390
That just has three twoils.|

2805
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,985
0,400 900,1535 1535,1640 1640,1820 1820,1985
Right 101 o one one

2806
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:19,120
0,120 120,395
o two.|

2807
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,695
0,305 305,725 725,845 845,1010 1010,1175
So postgresl has something called

2808
01:09:20,695 --> 01:09:22,560
0,135 135,635
the ctid.|

2809
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,430
0,335 335,545 545,695 695,815 815,920
And this is going to

2810
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,530
0,260 340,645 645,975 975,1250 1660,2100
be a twoo. Now that's

2811
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,420
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,555 555,890
going to give you the

2812
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,185
0,350 350,700 1020,1280 1280,1415 1415,1565
page number and then the

2813
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:30,910
0,195 195,485 1105,1365 1365,1545 1545,1725
slot number. So these two

2814
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:31,795
0,135 135,315 315,450 450,615 615,885
plus here are at page

2815
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:33,820
0,335 745,1065 1065,1355 1465,1800 1800,2025
zero, slot one, slot two,

2816
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,000
0,255 255,560
slot three.|

2817
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,060
0,320
Right.|

2818
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,380
0,245 245,490 840,1220 1220,1600
So now if I.|

2819
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,355
0,230 230,380 380,560 560,680 680,845
Say I delete the second

2820
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:42,360
0,345 345,570 570,765 765,900 900,1005
to I delete one on

2821
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,460
0,260
one.|

2822
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:44,400
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,605 605,770
Now when I do my

2823
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,240
0,320 640,1040
scan again.|

2824
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,235
0,275 275,395 395,500 500,635 635,815
Now you can see that

2825
01:09:47,235 --> 01:09:49,430
0,540 540,905 1195,1635 1635,1785 1785,2195
postgres side deleted the twople.|

2826
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,760
0,230 230,320 560,785 785,920 920,1130
But it didn't move things

2827
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,780
0,320
around.|

2828
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,180
0,260 260,395 395,530 530,710 710,980
And let the data where

2829
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,180
0,350 1150,1395 1395,1560 1560,1740 1740,2000
actually where it actually lives.|

2830
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:00,960
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,680 680,1150
But I can run garbage,

2831
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,880
0,245 245,500 500,760
the garbage collection.|

2832
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,855
0,380 380,725 725,935 935,1010 1010,1205
Let me start a ta

2833
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:06,300
0,245
back.|

2834
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,185
0,230 230,350 350,500 500,620 620,755
So I start one of

2835
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:08,360
0,275
three.|

2836
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,305
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,635 635,905
Now you can see again,

2837
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:12,020
0,255 255,660 660,930 930,1235 1315,1715
it didn't take that that

2838
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,425
0,395 395,710 710,950 950,1220 1220,1385
that o two slot from

2839
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:14,480
0,105 105,255 255,420 420,615 615,1055
the first two I deleted.|

2840
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,790
0,60 60,135 135,435 435,615 615,690
It is appended to the

2841
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:16,540
0,195 195,390 390,450 450,555 555,750
end, put it in slot

2842
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,480
0,290
four.|

2843
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,160
0,400
Right.|

2844
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,810
0,245 245,470 470,710 710,815 815,980
So then I can now

2845
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,880
0,270 270,620
run the.|

2846
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,930
0,275 275,425 425,740 740,890 890,980
Getting in postgres it's called

2847
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,260
0,120 120,560
a vacuum.|

2848
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,350
0,335 335,545 545,695 695,845 845,1310
So the command is vacuum.

2849
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,160
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,540 540,810
Again, this is a postgres

2850
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,410
0,410 820,1095 1095,1515 1515,1850 1960,2250
idiom, so vacuum full is

2851
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,960
0,135 135,240 240,495 495,1100 1150,1550
going to have postgres basically.|

2852
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,295
0,465 465,705 705,915 915,1110 1110,1275
Compact every single page and

2853
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:38,780
0,150 150,345 345,555 555,845 1135,1485
write out a new page,

2854
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,120
0,225 225,500
new files.|

2855
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,305
0,165 165,380 790,1020 1020,1095 1095,1185
So I I have a

2856
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:42,280
0,90 90,195 195,375 375,695 715,975
bunch of pages that are

2857
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,635
0,260 610,1350 1350,1515 1515,1820 2110,2355
empty. It'll release them when

2858
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:45,810
0,245 385,675 675,810 810,915 915,1175
it creates a new version.|

2859
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,945
0,245 245,440 440,620 620,710 710,815
So now when I do

2860
01:10:47,945 --> 01:10:49,720
0,120 120,285 285,495 495,785 1375,1775
that same query before, right

2861
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,155
0,305 305,470 470,725 725,965 965,1235
now, you see it compact

2862
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:54,095
0,135 135,255 255,545 1105,1505 2635,2940
of it, right? One o

2863
01:10:54,095 --> 01:10:56,000
0,165 165,330 330,635
two o three.|

2864
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,005
0,260 260,520 780,1180 1260,1490 1490,1595
Makes sense, yes. So is

2865
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,955
0,275 505,765 765,1175 1195,1710 1710,1950
this the cid referring to

2866
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:02,880
0,275
the?|

2867
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,320
0,275 275,470 470,740 740,1090
Page number and offset.|

2868
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,380
0,305 305,580
Slot number.|

2869
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,950
0,320 320,665 665,890 890,1100 1100,1220
Going backwards or in the

2870
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,940
0,225 225,560
slot array.|

2871
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,950
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,650 650,970
Is in the slot array

2872
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,160
0,245 245,335 335,455 455,650 650,830
because if you use the

2873
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,140
0,225 225,390 390,510 510,675 675,980
slot array to say what

2874
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,575
0,400 720,1010 1010,1160 1160,1310 1310,1415
offset within the page, do

2875
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:17,270
0,75 75,210 210,330 330,435 435,695
I find what I need?|

2876
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,770
0,400 600,890 890,1385 1385,1565 1565,1640
Yes, the sly seem to

2877
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,105
0,150 150,465 465,840 840,1080 1080,1335
be one index, because there's

2878
01:11:21,105 --> 01:11:22,520
0,225 225,495 495,815 865,1185 1185,1415
something at zero that's like.|

2879
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,615
0,245 245,395 395,700 1080,1355 1355,1595
The question is the slot

2880
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,980
0,305 415,720 720,900 900,1125 1125,1365
array starts at zero index

2881
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,435
0,150 150,240 240,345 345,620 1090,1455
even though the page zero

2882
01:11:28,435 --> 01:11:29,680
0,270 270,575 595,930 930,1110 1110,1245
index, sorry, slot array starts

2883
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,225
0,135 135,345 345,680 1060,1365 1365,1545
at one index, page starts

2884
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,170
0,165 165,405 405,660 660,810 810,945
at zero index. Is there

2885
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:34,645
0,240 240,590 1420,1710 1710,2000 2140,2475
something in? In one? Let's

2886
01:11:34,645 --> 01:11:35,920
0,105 105,365 685,990 990,1200 1200,1275
find out. So you're not

2887
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,790
0,120 120,225 225,330 330,555 555,870
supposed to do this, but

2888
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,710
0,255 255,560 640,1040 1540,1785 1785,1920
you can do. You can

2889
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,770
0,135 135,315 315,620 1510,1770 1770,2060
actually query this c tid

2890
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,000
0,400
equals.|

2891
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,160
0,275 275,550 690,1090
Then o O.|

2892
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,160
0,350 350,455 455,590 590,850
Doesn't have anything there.|

2893
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,230
0,290 290,440 440,530 530,620 620,710
But I can get the

2894
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,685
0,75 75,320 730,1110 1320,1395 1395,1455
other one, so I don't

2895
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:51,290
0,60 60,165 165,270 270,360 360,605
know why they do that.|

2896
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,840
0,400
Yes.|

2897
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,760
0,380 380,1000
Six bytes.|

2898
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,905
0,380 380,665 665,970 1470,1730 1730,1895
The statement is when we

2899
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:06,500
0,305 835,1140 1140,1475 2185,2460 2460,2595
say a slot, the c

2900
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,360
0,225 225,480 480,600 600,645 645,860
ID is going to be

2901
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,585
0,320 320,695 695,815 815,935 935,1145
six bytes. So it's probably

2902
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:09,880
0,270 270,495 495,825 825,1005 1005,1295
a four byte page number

2903
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,210
0,260 260,365 365,485 485,620 620,920
and then a two byte

2904
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,830
0,350 700,1050 1050,1200 1200,1440 1440,1620
offset. Doesn't that limit the

2905
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,195
0,195 195,530 820,1155 1155,1290 1290,1365
number of slots we can

2906
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:15,095
0,90 90,165 165,225 225,455 535,900
have in a page? Yes.

2907
01:12:15,095 --> 01:12:16,280
0,255 255,645 645,795 795,990 990,1185
But postgres is by default

2908
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,260
0,105 105,240 240,555 555,675 675,980
is eight kilobyte page sizes,

2909
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,185
0,245 245,365 365,575 575,725 725,905
so you can't have a

2910
01:12:18,185 --> 01:12:19,025
0,210 210,525 525,630 630,705 705,840
billion twoos in a single

2911
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:19,900
0,305
page.|

2912
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,285
0,260 260,440 440,695 860,920 920,995
All right, so let's look

2913
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,660
0,75 75,210 210,515
at other systems.|

2914
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,850
0,400 840,1175 1175,1640 1640,1850 1850,2090
So again, slite is it's

2915
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,075
0,230 760,1050 1050,1580 2770,3060 3060,3225
different. So slite this row

2916
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:31,980
0,275 595,995 1075,1350 1350,1665 1665,1905
ID again and it's actually

2917
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,795
0,255 255,590 1210,1530 1530,1620 1620,1815
storing this. It's A C

2918
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:35,160
0,195 195,455 655,990 990,1200 1200,1365
four bit. It actually stores

2919
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,815
0,290 400,800 1840,2175 2175,2445 2445,2655
this, so it uses this

2920
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:40,320
0,135 135,240 240,420 420,755
as the primary key.|

2921
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,345
0,320 320,515 515,650 650,800 800,905
Question is, the size of

2922
01:12:42,345 --> 01:12:43,040
0,60 60,150 150,270 270,420 420,695
the two will sort somewhere

2923
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,055
0,335 335,515 515,620 620,815 815,875
typically in the header of

2924
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,300
0,90 90,255 255,575
the tub, yes.|

2925
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,170
0,290 290,580 1140,1385 1385,1535 1535,1760
Right. So if we delete

2926
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,120
0,320
from.|

2927
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,940
0,400 420,665 665,770 770,890 890,1150
We delete a two po.|

2928
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,520
0,210 210,315 315,435 435,740 2440,2820
Run the same query. It

2929
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,680
0,375 375,645 645,780 780,900 900,1160
doesn't reuse the row ID.|

2930
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:01,815
0,180 180,285 285,420 420,510 510,720
Because it's actually a physical

2931
01:13:01,815 --> 01:13:03,380
0,255 255,390 390,585 585,935
thing, the primary key.|

2932
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,810
0,275 275,470 470,635 635,830 830,1090
All right, so let's do

2933
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,320
0,400
now.|

2934
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,880
0,350 350,610
Sql server.|

2935
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,140
0,400 540,890 890,1040 1040,1220 1220,1510
So sql server has this

2936
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,805
0,335 335,790 1620,1865 1865,1985 1985,2165
different syntax, it has this

2937
01:13:14,805 --> 01:13:16,190
0,305 565,900 900,975 975,1110 1110,1385
double that's hard to see.|

2938
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:17,910
0,245 245,350 350,530 530,710 710,860
If I highlight, I can

2939
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:18,880
0,120 120,350
see it.|

2940
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,480
0,105 105,240 240,540 540,645 645,870
Now there's 2% there's percent

2941
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,400
0,270 270,590 850,1140 1140,1430
signs there. Trust me.|

2942
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,140
0,60 60,120 120,225 225,485
So let's go back.|

2943
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,015
0,245 245,335 335,580 690,935 935,1025
There you go. There you

2944
01:13:36,015 --> 01:13:37,730
0,245 445,750 750,930 930,1265 1315,1715
go. There's percent signs, sorry.

2945
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,395
0,400 510,755 755,845 845,965 965,1145
So when you run this,

2946
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:42,090
0,150 150,300 300,585 585,965 1315,1695
you get back some hex

2947
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,780
0,150 150,300 300,560 640,1040
data like this, right?|

2948
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,480
0,260 260,365 365,500 500,790
What does this mean?|

2949
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:48,540
0,400 1020,1265 1265,1370 1370,1630 2160,3050
So there is an undocumented

2950
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,520
0,290 310,570 570,830 1600,1845 1845,1980
command. Actually, this is all

2951
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,120
0,165 165,255 255,390 390,495 495,600
you're not supposed to do.

2952
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,735
0,240 240,480 480,860 2620,2970 2970,3615
This, you can't. It's notumented,

2953
01:13:54,735 --> 01:13:56,295
0,245 385,735 735,1065 1065,1380 1380,1560
meaning Microsoft doesn't officially support

2954
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:58,515
0,275 355,755 1135,1545 1545,1805 1855,2220
this, but there's a command

2955
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:00,650
0,365 955,1320 1320,1560 1560,1785 1785,2135
called whatever this function here,

2956
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:01,755
0,245 245,380 380,575 575,740 740,845
and you pass in the

2957
01:14:01,755 --> 01:14:03,100
0,240 240,635
physical location.|

2958
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,105
0,120 120,255 255,630 630,765 765,1005
And then you'll get back

2959
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:06,600
0,335 925,1325 1405,1965 1965,2175 2175,2495
now the formatted file number,

2960
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,855
0,275 275,470 470,710 710,890 890,995
the page number, and then

2961
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:09,020
0,105 105,285 285,575
the slot number.|

2962
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,200
0,290
Right.|

2963
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,045
0,275 275,395 395,530 530,740 740,1085
And you can actually, it's

2964
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:13,980
0,240 240,545 1285,1545 1545,1680 1680,1935
interesting in learned this today,

2965
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,050
0,225 225,375 375,570 570,765 765,1070
you can actually get back

2966
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,815
0,320 320,640 810,1145 1145,1415 1415,1685
what the that function is

2967
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:18,405
0,195 195,455 1015,1260 1260,1425 1425,1590
actually doing. So you can

2968
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:19,190
0,105 105,210 210,315 315,495 495,785
get it to spit back

2969
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,555
0,400 1020,1235 1235,1355 1355,1505 1505,1625
the what it actually does.

2970
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:23,310
0,120 120,225 225,485 1285,1620 1620,1755
And you see they're taking

2971
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,720
0,150 150,405 405,800 1000,1275 1275,1410
that physical location and how

2972
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,665
0,165 165,300 300,435 435,600 600,945
they're jumping to different bytes

2973
01:14:25,665 --> 01:14:26,955
0,120 120,365 685,945 945,1065 1065,1290
to get the page ID

2974
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:28,005
0,255 255,540 540,780 780,885 885,1050
file number and the slot

2975
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,440
0,275
number.|

2976
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:31,575
0,75 75,165 165,285 285,405 405,540
So let's do the same

2977
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,045
0,120 120,195 195,270 270,515 1075,1470
thing we did before. Let's

2978
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:34,880
0,210 210,360 360,465 465,725
delete one o one.|

2979
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:36,895
0,245 245,365 365,470 470,590 590,755
Then we run the same

2980
01:14:36,895 --> 01:14:38,100
0,335
query.|

2981
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,375
0,260 260,425 425,730 750,1010 1010,1145
To get the page number

2982
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,250
0,455 835,1215 1215,1545 1545,1740 1740,1875
offsets right. So in this

2983
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,825
0,180 180,470 880,1140 1140,1350 1350,1575
case here, it didn't move

2984
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:44,840
0,365 835,1235
anything, right?|

2985
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,640
0,245 245,470 470,755 755,1060 1320,1760
So now if we insert

2986
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,800
0,120 120,315 315,560 1840,2070 2070,2160
our toolple back, a new

2987
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,880
0,380
duple.|

2988
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,860
0,275 275,410 410,560 560,880
Run that same query.|

2989
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,380
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,575 575,820
Now look what it did.|

2990
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:58,165
0,335 335,545 545,770 770,1120 1380,1655
So by two, four with

2991
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,785
0,275 295,555 555,705 705,995 1315,1620
ID one o two, that

2992
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:01,570
0,150 150,330 330,675 675,1055 1525,1785
was at slot two, but

2993
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,845
0,105 105,225 225,830 850,1110 1110,1275
when I inserted the new

2994
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:05,200
0,305 715,1035 1035,1355 1645,2040 2040,2355
table, it moved that second

2995
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,535
0,210 210,360 360,495 495,770 970,1335
two one o two into

2996
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,920
0,330 330,665
slot two.|

2997
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,720
0,210 210,390 390,710 1240,1485 1485,1800
And then put the newu

2998
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,200
0,225 225,495 495,830
into slot three.|

2999
01:15:12,115 --> 01:15:13,020
0,120 120,210 210,315 315,540 540,905
Postgres didn't do that right.

3000
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,590
0,440 440,575 575,755 755,950 950,1100
Postgres just kept depending on

3001
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,640
0,90 90,320
the end.|

3002
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,460
0,260 260,410 410,700
Is this wrong?|

3003
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,390
0,245 245,490 720,965 965,1070 1070,1330
Who knows, is it better?|

3004
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,640
0,245 245,490 900,1300
Who knows, right?|

3005
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,735
0,245 245,335 335,500 500,815 815,1085
And the reason why you

3006
01:15:25,735 --> 01:15:26,730
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,660 660,995
can do this is because

3007
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,170
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,800 800,1090
when you fetch a page

3008
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,340
0,260 260,380 380,605 605,830 830,1090
and bring it into memory

3009
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:30,870
0,290 290,455 455,620 620,755 755,1000
and you start, you know,

3010
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,160
0,485 485,575 575,770 770,920 920,1240
inserting a tple into it,

3011
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:33,685
0,320 320,500 500,695 695,1000 1050,1295
you're holding the latch or

3012
01:15:33,685 --> 01:15:34,770
0,120 120,375 375,615 615,780 780,1085
the lock on that page,

3013
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,835
0,350 350,695 695,980 980,1175 1175,1355
the data to decide whether

3014
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:37,585
0,120 120,240 240,345 345,435 435,750
it wants to do compaction

3015
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:38,620
0,240 240,405 405,555 555,870 870,1035
or whatever the optimization wants

3016
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,440
0,105 105,350
to do.|

3017
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,190
0,135 135,240 240,420 420,615 615,750
Because it knows that no

3018
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,120
0,210 210,480 480,660 660,810 810,930
other thread can write to

3019
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:41,765
0,105 105,270 270,405 405,495 495,645
that page at the same

3020
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:42,780
0,305
time.|

3021
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,740
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,735 735,960
So we can decide whether

3022
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,460
0,135 135,285 285,450 450,585 585,720
or not we want. We

3023
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,785
0,165 165,470 1600,1830 1830,1995 1995,2325
want to, you know, compact

3024
01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:47,685
0,105 105,180 180,425 505,780 780,900
it or not. As we

3025
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:48,465
0,75 75,180 180,480 480,690 690,780
do it, postcode doesn't do

3026
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:49,670
0,135 135,435 435,735 735,915 915,1205
it. Sql, sql server does.|

3027
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,760
0,275 275,410 485,650 650,860 860,1010
All right, let's look at

3028
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,660
0,120 120,210 210,375 375,890
everyone s favorite Oracle.|

3029
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,050
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,605 605,740
I need to create the

3030
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,740
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,740
table first, I think.|

3031
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,180
0,215 215,335 335,365 365,470 470,530
I don't think it's gonna

3032
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:05,825
0,60 60,150 150,270 270,465 465,645
let me do that. No,

3033
01:16:05,825 --> 01:16:07,380
0,90 90,335
it did.|

3034
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,160
0,305 305,470 470,970
So in Oracle.|

3035
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,050
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,590 590,850
They have a row ID.|

3036
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,260
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,665 665,920
Right. But you get again

3037
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,530
0,350 970,1515 1515,1740 1740,1965 1965,2270
some binary data here, right?|

3038
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,220
0,275 275,425 425,575 575,850
And again, this is.|

3039
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,480
0,290 290,710 710,845 845,965 965,1130
Stack overflow. This is not

3040
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,860
0,290 790,1080 1080,1275 1275,1305 1305,1380
me, but there's a bunch

3041
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,690
0,105 105,285 285,465 465,570 570,830
of functions you can do.

3042
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,525
0,275 275,550 2310,2615 2615,2795 2795,2945
Run this and you see

3043
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:28,695
0,225 225,525 525,720 720,975 975,1170
now they're storing an object

3044
01:16:28,695 --> 01:16:30,090
0,245 265,570 570,825 825,1140 1140,1395
ID, a file number, a

3045
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:30,840
0,195 195,390 390,510 510,600 600,750
block number or the page

3046
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,965
0,290 460,720 720,840 840,960 960,1125
number, and then the row

3047
01:16:31,965 --> 01:16:33,780
0,335
slot.|

3048
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,680
0,400 480,800 800,980 980,1115 1115,1390
So again, this is something

3049
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,130
0,335 335,560 560,875 875,1100 1100,1280
taking something that's defined in

3050
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,390
0,120 120,540 540,870 870,1050 1050,1260
the textbook, describing at like

3051
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,360
0,120 120,405 405,650 940,1340 1450,1970
a logical level or describing

3052
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,870
0,245 245,590 590,820 900,1250 1250,1310
a theoretical level. Here's how

3053
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,820
0,150 150,390 390,480 480,630 630,950
to organize your database system,

3054
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,060
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,575 575,710
and then you can see

3055
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,620
0,135 135,600 600,780 780,1040
different limitations of it.|

3056
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,610
0,285 285,600 600,690 690,765 765,990
Through sql you can then

3057
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,690
0,315 315,630 630,855 855,960 960,1080
see how you know they

3058
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,025
0,195 195,480 480,855 855,1140 1140,1335
are certain slots, sort things

3059
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,180
0,195 195,480 480,840 840,1085
in slot slotted pages.|

3060
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,780
0,210 210,440
All right.|

3061
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,305
0,260 260,455 455,680 680,815 815,935
All right, so in the

3062
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:56,800
0,150 150,330 330,635
sake of time.|

3063
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,700
0,275 275,395 455,500 500,575 575,770
I think I'm going to

3064
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,840
0,380
skip.|

3065
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,705
0,275 275,440 440,830 830,1150 1500,1805
This will segue into next

3066
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:06,540
0,285 285,665
class, but.|

3067
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,585
0,305 305,610 630,1030 1230,1550 1550,1745
The tub itself is just

3068
01:17:09,585 --> 01:17:10,065
0,105 105,165 165,225 225,315 315,480
going to be a sequence

3069
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:11,460
0,165 165,575
of bytes.|

3070
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,190
0,335 335,455 455,880 1140,1540 1560,1820
There's some header and then

3071
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:15,525
0,105 105,285 285,530 970,1230 1230,1335
a byte sequence, and then

3072
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:16,260
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,510 510,735
it's up for the database

3073
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,580
0,300 300,540 540,830 910,1155 1155,1320
system to know how to

3074
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,260
0,225 225,420 420,920 1210,1515 1515,1680
interpret those bytes based on

3075
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,195
0,150 150,440 730,1130 1420,1710 1710,1935
the type and based on

3076
01:17:21,195 --> 01:17:22,455
0,195 195,455 685,960 960,1125 1125,1260
the values that you're looking

3077
01:17:22,455 --> 01:17:23,300
0,305
at.|

3078
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,290
0,210 210,345 345,570 570,720 720,990
So again, we'll cover this

3079
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,340
0,300 300,600 600,855 855,960 960,1050
next class, but the way

3080
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:25,960
0,90 90,165 165,270 270,375 375,620
to think about this is.|

3081
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:27,815
0,275 275,335 335,470 470,785 785,1025
There'll be some header that

3082
01:17:27,815 --> 01:17:29,060
0,335 415,705 705,870 870,1065 1065,1245
contains information on whether this

3083
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,145
0,260 460,735 735,855 855,1100 1840,2085
two this or not. We

3084
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:31,835
0,135 135,315 315,450 450,570 570,690
can store, you know, whether

3085
01:17:31,835 --> 01:17:32,270
0,90 90,195 195,285 285,345 345,435
or not we want to

3086
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,245
0,260 280,540 540,675 675,810 810,975
store, keep track of what

3087
01:17:33,245 --> 01:17:35,110
0,270 270,405 405,905 1315,1590 1590,1865
columns have nulls and then

3088
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,985
0,365 365,680 680,920 920,1085 1085,1235
then the execution engine will

3089
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:39,005
0,165 165,300 300,545 655,915 915,1020
know how to jump to

3090
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:40,420
0,150 150,555 555,795 795,1020 1020,1415
different offsets within the tole

3091
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,940
0,305 305,455 455,605 605,1030
based on the schema.|

3092
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,370
0,320 320,530 530,770 770,935 935,1240
So again, we'll cover this

3093
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,555
0,275 275,455 455,760 1380,1610 1610,1715
in next class, but just

3094
01:17:45,555 --> 01:17:47,080
0,120 120,285 285,605
to finish up.|

3095
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,320
0,350 350,575 575,740 740,860 860,920
Again what we what do

3096
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,595
0,90 90,240 240,530 940,1215 1215,1275
we discussed today? There's a

3097
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:53,605
0,225 225,605 1435,1680 1680,1845 1845,2010
database system to maintain a

3098
01:17:53,605 --> 01:17:54,415
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,720 720,810
database that data is going

3099
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:56,425
0,135 135,450 450,755 1555,1830 1830,2010
be tracked in across different

3100
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:58,030
0,305 775,1110 1110,1320 1320,1470 1470,1605
files and broke up into

3101
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,425
0,260 910,1155 1155,1230 1230,1290 1290,1395
pages and then we have

3102
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,205
0,180 180,345 345,465 465,615 615,780
different ways to keep track

3103
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:01,510
0,120 120,255 255,545 835,1125 1125,1305
of those pages keep track

3104
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,425
0,165 165,360 360,570 570,795 795,915
of what's and how to

3105
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:03,180
0,150 150,285 285,375 375,480 480,755
store things in those pages

3106
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,375
0,245 245,365 365,545 545,725 725,875
and then next class we'll

3107
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,155
0,60 60,195 195,450 450,675 675,780
talk about what how to

3108
01:18:05,155 --> 01:18:07,225
0,90 90,225 225,360 360,725 1825,2070
store actually the twoples so

3109
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:08,200
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,780 780,975
again lot discuss next next
