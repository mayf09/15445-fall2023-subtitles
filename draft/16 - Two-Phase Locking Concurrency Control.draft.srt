00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,620
0,350 350,620 620,1150 1560,1985 1985,2260
Thank you, DJ. {That's,great. -}|

2
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,185
0,400 450,725 725,875 875,1150 1590,1925
So did you have any

3
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,290
0,545 565,965 1705,2105 2485,2895 2895,3105
takers for your tiki bar

4
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,625
0,255 255,450 450,585 585,795 795,1335
thing and the other performances

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:39,040
0,135 135,255 255,515 1105,1505
that you had to?|

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,045
0,400 570,875 875,1205 1205,1480 1620,1955
Okay, okay, that's great. {All,right.

7
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:43,830
0,335 595,995 1165,1515 1515,1635 1635,1785
{-},So -} we're going to

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,415
0,165 165,470 670,1070 2860,3255 3255,3585
get started and needed to

9
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,675
0,225 225,495 495,765 765,990 990,1260
clean up a couple things

10
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,225
0,335 535,870 870,1185 1185,1565 2215,2550
that from {last,lecture. -} Remember

11
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,200
0,255 255,525 525,750 750,870 870,975
this slide where we are

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,230
0,225 225,590 790,1190 1780,2745 2745,3030
looking at the interleaving when

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,450
0,105 105,180 180,390 390,660 660,1220
we are thinking about schedules.|

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,360
0,315 315,570 570,705 705,900 900,1220
And we had this schedule,

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,700
0,290 290,485 485,790 900,1300 1440,1840
and this schedule is actually

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,125
0,380 380,710 710,1060 1680,1985 1985,2225
a correct schedule, right, even

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,000
0,195 195,330 330,480 480,1295 1525,1875
though that is interleaving because

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,260
0,270 270,590
t one.|

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,180
0,240 240,585 585,855 855,1130
Mix change to a.|

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,340
0,350 670,1005 1005,1340 1480,1845 1845,2160
Then t two makes change

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,420
0,195 195,360 360,570 570,810 810,1080
to a by giving six

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,160
0,320 610,1010
percent interest.|

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,520
0,275 275,440 440,665 665,890 890,1070
One then comes back and

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,945
0,210 210,530 550,825 825,1100 1120,1425
makes changes to b, so

25
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,085
0,225 225,465 465,600 600,825 825,1140
puts back the 100 dollars

26
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,540
0,240 240,420 420,585 585,845 1165,1455
from a to b, so

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,755
0,210 210,420 420,615 615,920 940,1215
now a and b, the

28
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:20,870
0,180 180,345 345,480 480,735 735,1115
sum of that is consistent.

29
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,070
0,400 600,920 920,1130 1130,1325 1325,1520
{So,now -} when t two

30
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,650
0,290 370,675 675,945 945,1245 1245,1580
goes and at six percent

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,120
0,320 320,485 485,635 635,890 890,1240
interest to be this correct,

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,830
0,320 320,500 500,620 620,740 740,1510
even though there was interleaving,

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,715
0,290 290,920 920,1145 1145,1480 1500,1775
that interleaving was safe and

34
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,990
0,120 120,285 285,540 540,875 985,1275
you ended up with one

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,510
0,165 165,315 315,555 555,1230 1230,1520
of the two legitimate ways

36
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,720
0,275 275,470 470,650 650,800 800,1010
in which to do this

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,225
0,320 1360,1650 1650,1815 1815,2090 2200,2505
transaction because you had the

38
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:38,400
0,305 385,785 985,1385 1735,2025 2025,2175
right final value in the

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,380
0,260
database.|

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,165
0,400 690,1025 1025,1295 1295,1490 1490,1625
Okay, so even though this

41
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:42,890
0,660 660,870 870,1170 1170,1485 1485,1725
interleaving at first seems like,

42
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,020
0,195 195,375 375,675 675,840 840,1130
oh, it shouldn't work out?|

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,940
0,320 320,590 590,940 1230,1630 1800,2150
If this be happened before

44
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,870
0,240 240,465 465,585 585,750 750,930
this suite of b then

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,200
0,150 150,285 285,405 405,650
we would be off.|

46
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,970
0,305 305,485 485,620 620,770 770,1060
Okay, does that make sense?|

47
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,430
0,245 245,425 425,680 680,875 875,1040
The bottom value will still

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,330
0,135 135,225 225,435 435,705 705,900
be the same because this

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,365
0,180 180,330 330,510 510,765 765,1035
is the same as having

50
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,715
0,335 445,735 735,915 915,1140 1140,1350
run t one followed by

51
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:00,600
0,165 165,450 450,660 660,750 750,885
t 2. That's the whole

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
0,290 370,675 675,930 930,1200 1200,1520
point. {This,schedule -} is okay.|

53
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,870
0,305 305,610 660,1060 1260,1520 1520,1700
Right. {So,some, -} the main

54
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,370
0,240 240,450 450,645 645,1290 1290,1500
point is some interleaving is

55
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,100
0,350 400,690 690,1290 1290,1440 1440,1730
okay, some interleaving is {not.,And

56
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,430
0,275 275,410 410,605 605,935 935,1220
-} the whole purpose with

57
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,375
0,165 165,345 345,495 495,735 735,945
what we'll talk about today

58
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,240
0,275 295,585 585,795 795,1115 1465,1865
is when to determine well

59
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
0,290 290,455 455,590 590,850 1260,1520
is there a mechanism to

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,785
0,105 105,285 285,555 555,765 765,885
go and determine how to

61
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,200
0,240 240,525 525,815
make everything safe?|

62
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,650
0,260 260,410 410,680 680,1060 1380,1780
Okay, the next slide was

63
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,300
0,395 395,650 650,800 800,1010 1010,1330
something that is not safe,

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,935
0,275 275,470 470,790 1650,1985 1985,2255
which is essentially t one

65
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,360
0,300 300,525 525,705 705,1025 1135,1425
starts to make change to

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,380
0,290
a.|

67
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,105
0,270 270,555 555,890 1000,1400 1420,1725
Then t two starts to

68
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,380
0,225 225,510 510,750 750,990 990,1275
make changes to both a

69
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,640
0,225 225,530
and b.|

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,500
0,105 105,255 255,405 405,570 570,860
And then t one makes

71
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,965
0,335 335,635 635,905 905,1070 1070,1265
the remaining change it needed

72
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:32,780
0,180 180,285 285,390 390,525 525,815
to make in its transaction

73
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,860
0,260 260,520 750,1055 1055,1360 1620,1970
to b, and so that

74
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,390
0,350 460,765 765,1050 1050,1320 1320,1530
value for a was seen

75
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,060
0,210 210,405 910,1215 1215,1395 1395,1670
by t 2 the final

76
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,675
0,380 380,635 635,755 755,935 935,1145
result for the values of

77
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,760
0,135 135,285 285,495 495,810 810,1085
a and b doesn't correspond

78
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,030
0,290 290,530 530,785 785,980 980,1130
to any one of the

79
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,560
0,330 330,750 750,1070
serial schedules. Yep.|

80
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,560
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,875 875,1120
Why is to severely bad?|

81
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,475
0,365 365,695 695,980 980,1160 1160,1295
You be equal to like

82
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:48,810
0,225 225,540 540,840 840,1110 1110,1335
that specific number was okay

83
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,610
0,165 165,300 300,435 435,555 555,800
and like how we, yeah,

84
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,260
0,320 320,590
how do?|

85
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,140
0,350 400,690 690,980 1300,1620 1620,1680
Specifically that value. {We're,going -}

86
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,760
0,60 60,180 180,330 330,570
to talk about that.|

87
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,085
0,290 290,530 530,755 755,935 935,1175
We talked about that last

88
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:56,805
0,225 225,375 375,495 495,600 600,720
class, but let me go

89
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,215
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,845 1015,1410
back to that, right? So

90
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,700
0,285 285,495 495,815 985,1245 1245,1485
the whole definition, because it's

91
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,975
0,285 285,525 525,660 660,950 1000,1275
important, the whole definition of

92
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,940
0,480 480,785 1405,1695 1695,1845 1845,1965
serial schedule is that if

93
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,010
0,180 180,315 315,540 540,765 765,1070
I've got these two transactions,

94
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,380
0,290 455,605 605,770 770,1060
t 1 t two.|

95
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,420
0,350 700,1005 1005,1310 1360,1740 1740,2040
And I can have a

96
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,700
0,320 670,975 975,1280 1720,2040 2040,2280
schedule in which t one

97
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,050
0,255 255,540 540,765 765,930 930,1350
runs followed by t 2.

98
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,340
0,240 240,470 490,765 765,990 990,1290
I'll get a certain number,

99
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,425
0,255 255,510 510,1070 1210,1610 1780,2085
or vice versa. {So,here -}

0,180 180,390 390,930 930,1140 1140,1350
is the diagram, which will

101
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,750
0,150 150,360 360,630 630,840 840,975
come back again in a

0,285 285,495 495,630 630,810 810,1035
the in a little bit

104
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,505
0,210 210,420 420,630 630,900 900,1125
in about 40 minutes {from,now.

105
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:23,810
0,275 595,855 855,975 975,1125 1125,1305
-} Let me just go

106
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,920
0,150 150,360 360,660 660,900 900,1110
to that slide in which

107
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
0,195 195,420 420,770 1150,1695 1695,2000
we had the serial schedule.|

108
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,580
0,365 365,695 695,1060
Skip, skip, skip.|

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,630
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,525 525,630
I guess what I was

110
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,665
0,135 135,300 300,570 570,810 810,1035
saying? Like, what? What if

111
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,000
0,390 390,525 525,690 690,965 1015,1335
they're not the same like?|

112
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,775
0,195 195,375 375,600 600,870 870,1095
You ran those two in

113
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,035
0,135 135,330 330,555 555,845 955,1260
a different order they came

00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:37,320
0,255
with.|

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,770
0,400 420,920 920,1270 1410,1730 1730,1940
Yeah, that's so okay. {So,this

116
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,195
0,165 165,345 345,650 760,1125 1125,1425
-} is the notion of

117
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,380
0,545
correctness.|

118
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,340
0,330 330,585 585,825 825,1190
So the question is.|

119
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,300
0,180 180,360 360,585 585,795 795,960
T one followed by t

120
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,190
0,165 165,315 315,450 450,600 600,890
two there were two possible

121
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,270
0,320 320,515 515,665 665,800 800,1060
ways in which the database

122
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,470
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,815 815,1150
could end up with right.|

123
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,800
0,180 180,345 345,465 465,570 570,720
And what we are saying

124
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,790
0,210 210,465 465,660 660,795 795,990
is both of them are

125
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,455
0,320 580,900 900,1095 1095,1350 1350,1665
correct. {Both,are -} not correct

126
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,750
0,210 210,315 315,540 540,915 915,1295
because we are operating under

127
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,925
0,400 630,1640 1640,2105 2105,2285 2285,2435
the serializable assumption that these

128
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,890
0,150 150,570 570,1355 1555,1830 1830,1965
are conflicts serializable if we

129
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,630
0,150 150,300 300,525 525,1005 1005,1740
were to say strictly serializable

130
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,770
0,225 225,510 510,675 675,900 900,1140
that there's only one order

131
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,730
0,225 225,375 375,600 600,810 810,960
t one followed by t

132
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,780
0,240 240,480 480,645 645,810 810,1050
two, because t one started

133
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,760
0,350 670,945 945,1110 1110,1400
first, that would be.|

134
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,300
0,180 180,530 670,1230 1230,1550 2140,2540
A more restrictive form of

135
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,470
0,395 395,1130 1130,1480 1710,2000 2000,2150
ah, concurrency control and we

136
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,225
0,345 345,645 645,900 900,1125 1125,1755
wouldn't allow as much parallelism

137
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:14,695
0,165 165,455 535,1200 1200,1335 1335,1470
with transactions overlapping with each

138
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,180
0,275 535,810 810,1050 1050,1215 1215,1485
other. {So,we're -} doing something

139
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,760
0,240 240,480 480,830 970,1335 1335,1580
that seems {funny.,We're -} saying

140
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
0,500 500,850 930,1330 1500,1805 1805,2000
it's okay if t one

141
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,535
0,210 210,525 525,870 870,1200 1200,1455
came first, but the way

142
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:22,765
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,725 835,1230
in which the database state

143
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,505
0,395 775,1110 1110,1335 1335,1530 1530,1740
is looks like t two

144
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:25,675
0,210 210,405 405,570 570,825 825,1170
ran all of it, followed

145
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:27,250
0,240 240,420 835,1155 1155,1365 1365,1575
by t 1 that order

146
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,170
0,240 240,435 435,585 585,690 690,920
{is,okay. -} So we are

147
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,540
0,605 605,910
accepting that.|

148
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,575
0,350 350,1240 1350,1625 1625,1760 1760,1925
Little discrepancy because we want

149
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,540
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,1235 1675,1965
to allow more parallelization if

150
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,530
0,195 195,510 510,690 690,870 870,990
we didn't want to, we

151
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,625
0,135 135,315 315,620 700,960 960,1095
could do something. {We,can -}

152
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,240
0,135 135,270 270,405 405,510 510,615
come up with a new

153
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,785
0,510 510,705 705,1110 1110,1275 1275,1545
concrency control protocol in which

154
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,200
0,255 255,495 495,875
a simple one.|

155
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,145
0,225 225,360 360,480 480,705 705,945
Not a good idea, but

156
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:40,955
0,135 135,330 330,540 540,675 675,810
a simple one that will

157
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,455
0,195 195,375 375,635 655,1290 1290,1500
work with that intuitive notion

158
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:43,685
0,225 225,515 535,825 825,1005 1005,1230
is, say, if t one

159
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,275
0,480 480,765 765,960 960,1265 1315,1590
arrives before t two t

160
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:46,600
0,210 210,615 615,795 795,1020 1020,1325
one locks the entire database.|

161
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,215
0,135 135,285 285,450 450,600 600,795
And then t two runs.

162
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:49,420
0,225 225,390 390,600 600,870 870,1205
{That,was -} the default mechanism

163
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,040
0,290 290,470 470,605 605,740 740,1030
by which we would get

164
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,150
0,380 380,1040 1040,1385 1385,1715 1715,1940
this isolation {property.,But -} it

165
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,545
0,165 165,440 820,1080 1080,1215 1215,1395
{would,work. -} Everything would seem

166
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,795
0,665 835,1170 1170,1395 1395,1890 1890,2250
logical, but you wouldn't allow

167
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,360
0,270 270,915 915,1155 1155,1305 1305,1565
enough parallelism in the system.|

168
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,325
0,230 230,305 305,425 425,700 750,1145
Okay and as I mentioned

169
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,085
0,345 345,695 895,1295 1585,2315 2425,2760
last time is spanner has

170
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,825
0,240 240,545 625,1025 1255,1560 1560,1740
this notion where this t

171
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:05,665
0,165 165,390 390,585 585,720 720,840
one followed by t two

00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,080
0,120 120,345 345,695 715,1065 1065,1415
is feeling odd, right? Because

173
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,410
0,260 260,395 395,640 660,965 965,1220
we arere saying a schedule

174
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,375
0,225 225,420 420,675 675,1010 1240,1965
in which t two finishes

175
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,560
0,315 315,630 630,885 885,1035 1035,1185
and changes the state of

176
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,595
0,105 105,345 345,630 630,810 810,1035
the database and t one

177
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,940
0,335 865,1265 1315,1620 1620,1925 1945,2345
runs is a fine final

178
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
0,290 290,455 455,575 575,820 1110,1400
state for the database. {That,seems

179
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,410
0,195 195,450 450,675 675,825 825,1050
-} odd because t one

180
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,565
0,330 330,570 570,825 825,975 975,1155
arrives first in all the

181
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,545
0,300 300,555 555,815 1165,1485 1485,1980
examples we {have.,So -} spanner

182
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:23,280
0,240 240,575 805,1205 1495,1895 2335,2735
has this additional notion of

183
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,540
0,320 320,1115 1115,1325 1325,1630 1860,2210
strict serializable in which it

184
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,010
0,350 520,810 810,1005 1005,1260 1260,1470
says if they arrive in

185
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,180
0,120 120,330 330,675 675,990 990,1170
a certain order then we

186
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,620
0,150 150,440 490,795 795,1100 1120,1440
will actually make it more

187
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,735
0,320 760,1110 1110,1380 1380,1605 1605,2115
meaningful while still {along,parallelism. -}

188

0,165 165,600 600,765 765,960 960,1265
The protocol is really complicated

189
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,810
0,275 275,550 570,920 920,1250 1250,1580
and I flash that slide

190
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,160
0,255 255,435 435,710 880,1155 1155,1350
at the end to say

191
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,255
0,180 180,420 420,675 675,930 930,1095
if you're interested go take

0,150 150,300 300,465 465,660 660,965
a look at that paper

193

0,290 290,545 545,695 695,875 875,1100
and there's all kinds of

194
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,410
0,350 370,705 705,930 930,1380 1380,1770

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,870
0,450 450,690 690,885 885,1005 1005,1250
spanner requires that they actually

198
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,250
0,365 365,650 650,830 830,1025 1025,1360
Google keeps the data centers

199
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,345
0,670 720,1055 1055,1445 1445,1565 1565,1715
synced the clocks on each

200
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,485
0,150 150,330 330,615 615,840 840,1140
{of,those -} sync. That allows

201
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:51,670
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,845 895,1185
them to figure out how

202
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,600
0,210 210,405 405,540 540,720 720,930
much should I hold back

203
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,980
0,165 165,440 940,1200 1200,1290 1290,1380
a transaction so that I

204
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,090
0,150 150,440 550,840 840,990 990,1110
can know if some of

205
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,440
0,120 120,380 550,885 885,1125 1125,1350
the transactions started in real

206
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,625
0,300 300,585 585,855 855,1095 1095,1185
time before it so that

207
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,450
0,150 150,390 390,555 555,660 660,825
I retire in the same

208
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,320
0,210 210,500
time order.|

209
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,615
0,260 260,455 455,700 1260,1660 1710,2015
Because it's complicated and take

210
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:02,845
0,195 195,390 390,695 715,1035 1035,1230
the advanced database class for

211
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:03,985
0,165 165,330 330,555 555,870 870,1140
that. {But,the -} confusion you're

212
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:04,900
0,135 135,315 315,435 435,675 675,915
having and the questions that

213
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,770
0,120 120,255 255,390 390,615 615,870
you guys are asking is

214
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,170
0,285 285,705 705,825 825,1050 1050,1400
like, doesn't it seem feel

215
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,160
0,400 840,1145 1145,1400 1400,1670 1670,1970
weird? It does feel weird

216
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,330
0,270 270,390 390,600 600,900 900,1170
because we are operating under

217
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,900
0,350 400,800 820,1460 1480,1880 2170,2570
this more relaxed notion of

218
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,295
0,400 450,1130 1130,1355 1355,1490 1490,1805
conflict serializer we're saying we'll

219
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,620
0,225 225,450 450,995 1315,1715
allow these schedules because.|

220
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,795
0,400 1140,1505 1505,1745 1745,1865 1865,1985
The performance that we need

221
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,920
0,150 150,360 360,695 715,990 990,1125
is high enough, and the

222
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,350
0,165 165,345 345,810 810,1065 1065,1430
change in semantics is reasonable,

223
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,785
0,290 290,440 440,700 750,1070 1070,1235
that we think applications are

224
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:24,415
0,105 105,210 210,300 300,450 450,630
going to be fine with

225
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,120
0,275
it.|

226
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,480
0,350 350,560 560,695 695,905 905,1100
So this is the universe

227
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,580
0,165 165,450 450,690 690,825 825,1100
of schedule. {What,would -} the

0,305 305,610
universe of?|

229
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,890
0,335 335,560 560,850 1290,1690 2070,2390
Results or like solutions? Or.|

230
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,920
0,400 600,875 875,1025 1025,1250 1250,1490
Yeah. {So,the -} question is

231
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,165
0,225 225,450 450,705 705,930 930,1245
what's the universe of solutions?

232
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,230
0,240 240,450 450,645 645,870 870,1065
If there's a universe of

233
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,900
0,560 640,915 915,1080 1080,1320 1320,1670
schedules, they will mirror that,

234
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,680
0,305 305,590 590,1310 1310,1445 1445,1580
because conflict serializable will give

235
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,140
0,120 120,330 330,540 540,800 1060,1460
a certain set of potential

236
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,280
0,350 350,560 560,665 665,785 785,1060
solutions for the end database,

237
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,130
0,275 275,410 410,500 500,590 590,740
right? If you have two

238
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,615
0,290 640,975 975,1170 1170,1305 1305,1485
transactions, any one of those

239
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:45,620
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,810 810,1005
two, if there are three,

240
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,350
0,180 180,705 705,915 915,1190 1330,1730
the permutation of {that.,So -}

241
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,115
0,305 305,545 545,1130 1130,1430 1430,1685
it also embodies what's final

242
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,120
0,270 270,405 405,510 510,750 750,1005
state of {the,database. -} If

243
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,365
0,90 90,195 195,570 570,855 855,1245
you had concurrent actions, they

244
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,860
0,285 285,525 525,750 750,1025
they mirror each other.|

245
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,960
0,350 350,560 560,695 695,815 815,950
So are they the same

246
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
0,210 210,480 480,830
size as before?|

247
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,790
0,260 260,485 485,710 710,845 845,1120
If I understand your question

248
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,290
0,335 335,755 755,965 965,1175 1175,1480
correct, it's about like, what

249
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,350
0,305 305,470 470,635 635,815 815,950
can you say about the

250
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,520
0,255 255,510 510,630 630,840 840,1170
properties of the final values

251
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,160
0,240 240,345 345,590 910,1275 1275,1640
in the database? They exactly

252
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,445
0,350 350,560 560,820 870,1130 1130,1265
are the definition of this.

253
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,720
0,195 195,285 285,420 420,540 540,785
They're 1 the same.|

254
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,645
0,290 290,580 660,1010 1010,1325 1325,1565
All right, other questions on

255
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,760
0,225 225,480 480,660 660,825 825,1115
this before we move on

256
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,470
0,395 395,650 650,860 860,1130 1130,1450
to the topic for today?|

257
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,845
0,350 350,470 470,650 650,800 800,935
We'll come back to this

258
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,710
0,485 505,905 925,1215 1215,1485 1485,1865
diagram in a different form,

259
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,530
0,400 450,1060 1560,1895 1895,2135 2135,2440
so let's close this out

260
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,265
0,400 750,1055 1055,1265 1265,1445 1445,1655
and bring up the next

261
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,300
0,335
deck.|

262
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,955
0,275 275,410 410,605 605,830 830,1085
All right, so today we'll

263
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,030
0,225 225,605 955,1260 1260,1515 1515,2075
talk about two phase locking.|

264
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,140
0,380 1000,1400 1810,2145 2145,2370 2370,2520
And the part that we

265
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,930
0,260 1120,1485 1485,1815 1815,2180 2500,2790
will worry about is how

266
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,650
0,150 150,270 270,435 435,600 600,720
do we make all of

267
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,970
0,150 150,690 690,945 945,1155 1155,1320
these mechanisms happen. {We,talked -}

268
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,215
0,225 225,660 660,1005 1005,1125 1125,1245
about dependence graphs in the

269
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:35,625
0,195 195,545 685,1020 1020,1245 1245,1410
last slide, but before we

270
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,520
0,225 225,495 495,780 780,1025 1495,1895
jump into today's topic, just

271
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,610
0,260 260,380 380,560 560,800 800,1010
there was a request for

272
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,795
0,270 270,570 570,765 765,945 945,1185
project three to push back

273
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:40,740
0,195 195,450 450,720 720,840 840,945
the date because we were

274
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,790
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,680 760,1050
a few days out in

275
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,675
0,225 225,450 450,585 585,720 720,885
getting that to {you.,So -}

276
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:43,425
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,585 585,750
we moved it back by

277
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:44,955
0,210 210,545 835,1185 1185,1380 1380,1530
{seven,days. -} Hopefully, you don't

278
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:45,810
0,105 105,240 240,375 375,570 570,855
need all the seven days,

279
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,635
0,225 225,375 375,510 510,660 660,825
but if you do, you

280
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,560
0,180 180,485
have it.|

281
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,745
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,815 815,935
As I mentioned in the

282
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:50,035
0,210 210,575 745,990 990,1095 1095,1290
last class, there are lots

283
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,100
0,225 225,450 450,735 735,945 945,1065
of moving parts in the

284
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,765
0,260 580,855 855,1110 1110,1365 1365,1665
project, so don't wait till

285
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:53,680
0,195 195,360 360,570 570,780 780,915
like two days before the

286
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,040
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,830
deadline to do it.|

287
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,630
0,180 180,500 520,870 870,1220 1300,1590
It will seem harder than

288
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,935
0,210 210,530 640,915 915,1065 1065,1305
it is if you wait

289
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,525
0,300 300,635 955,1245 1245,1425 1425,1590
that long. {Okay,,knock -} out

290
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,280
0,135 135,360 360,690 690,1055
the simple things first.|

291
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,340
0,380 380,760 1620,2015 2015,2330 2330,2630
Hum four got pushed out

292
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,000
0,380 850,1250 1450,1850 1930,2385 2385,2660
earlier today and that's due

293
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,560
0,350 350,650 650,1120
on november 12th.|

294
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,440
0,290 290,455 455,880 1050,1450 1650,2050
Okay, so let's jump into

295
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,360
0,275 275,515 515,815 815,1150
the topic for today.|

296
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,025
0,195 195,470 610,1005 1005,1380 1380,1665
We will concern ourselves with

297
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,920
0,270 270,635 805,1835 2275,2625 2625,2895
this conflict serializable class of

298
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,045
0,480 480,675 675,795 795,945 945,1125
schedules that we want to

299
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:20,960
0,275
allow.|

300
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,395
0,365 365,650 650,815 815,995 995,1235
And remember, we also talked

301
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,880
0,225 225,465 465,1215 1215,1350 1350,1485
about view serializable in which

302
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,570
0,120 120,285 285,450 450,555 555,690
if I knew a little

303
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,130
0,180 180,330 330,555 555,885 885,1560
bit about the application semantics,

304
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,150
0,240 240,435 435,660 660,840 840,1020
I could allow a few

305
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,115
0,240 240,830 1120,1485 1485,1860 1860,1965
more schedules. {That,tends -} to

306
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,135
0,105 105,285 285,540 540,795 795,1020
be very hard to enforce

307
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,260
0,195 195,485 505,780 780,930 930,1125
and {practice.,No -} one {does,that.

308
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,745
0,320 400,675 675,825 825,1305 1305,1485
-} But the textbooks have

309
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,990
0,305 385,675 675,855 855,1035 1035,1245
it so that you just

310
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,810
0,255 255,590 820,1170 1170,1470 1470,1820
know what {those,things -} are.

311
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,510
0,500 500,725 725,1025 1025,1420 1980,2380
It's good to understand that,

312
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,870
0,275 275,500 500,695 695,950 950,1220
but we'll focus on conflict

313
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,580
0,920 970,1260 1260,1440 1440,1590 1590,1710
serializable and how do we

314
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,700
0,150 150,345 345,650
make that work?|

315
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,190
0,380 380,710 710,980 980,1175 1175,1450
So last class, we said.|

316
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,175
0,290 290,530 530,800 800,980 980,1115
If you start to draw

317
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,360
0,165 165,555 555,825 825,1050 1050,1185
the dependence graph, you see

318
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,245
0,120 120,380 430,660 660,750 750,885
a cycle. {We,are -} in

319
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,120
0,275
trouble.|

320
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,500
0,320 320,640 720,995 995,1115 1115,1220
Right. {But,how -} do you

321
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,165
0,150 150,440 580,980 1150,1440 1440,1665
draw the cycle and we're

322
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,350
0,150 150,315 315,540 540,900 900,1185
drawing the cycle after the

323
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,700
0,285 285,585 585,890 970,1215 1215,1350
schedule was done, so it's

324
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,470
0,90 90,210 210,345 345,495 495,770
like, is it too late?

325
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,640
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,635 635,940
How do you make sure

326
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,230
0,290 290,455 455,845 845,1115 1115,1360
that the cyclecles don't form,

327
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,325
0,640 810,1115 1115,1325 1325,1520 1520,1745
aka give us this notion

328
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:01,660
0,270 270,735 735,945 945,1155 1155,1335
of correctness that we're looking

329
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,025
0,350 520,855 855,1080 1080,1230 1230,1365
for, right? When is it

330
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,390
0,210 210,390 390,825 825,1055 1105,1365
safe to interleave actions? So

331
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,370
0,195 195,315 315,510 510,675 675,980
that's what we'll talk {about.,And

332
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,095
0,400 1560,1820 1820,1910 1910,2140 2160,2465
-} there are multiple ways

333
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,980
0,165 165,285 285,545
to do it.|

334
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,960
0,165 165,285 285,450 450,645 645,980
We're going to talk about.|

335
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,980
0,650 650,875 875,1040 1040,1300
Locks as a mechanism.|

336
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,440
0,120 120,240 240,465 465,830
To do that today.|

337
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,310
0,135 135,225 225,360 360,585 585,870
And if you remember last

338
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,270
0,300 300,510 510,675 675,840 840,960
class, we said there are

339
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,390
0,260 280,675 675,1065 1065,1350 1350,2120
two broad classes of algorithms.|

340
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,370
0,225 225,435 435,1035 1035,1185 1185,1290
One is pessimistic and the

341
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,200
0,120 120,285 285,435 435,710 1360,1830
other one is optimistic. {Locks,are

342
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,090
0,150 150,440 1180,1575 1575,1695 1695,1890
-} {optimistic.,Locks -} are sorry

343
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,715
0,470 820,1170 1170,1520 2050,2385 2385,2625
pessim they will try to

344
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,275
0,285 285,525 525,765 765,1020 1020,1560
stop a cycle from forming

345
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,820
0,345 345,645 645,995 1135,1410 1410,1545
very {early,on. -} And when

346
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,490
0,120 120,285 285,465 465,740 1270,1670
we talk about optimistic, ah,

347
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,255
0,650 650,845 845,1265 1265,1370 1370,1475
conccy control protocols, in the

348
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,590
0,165 165,485 625,975 975,1125 1125,1335
next class you'll see they

349
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,670
0,195 195,375 375,495 495,740 760,1080
will {do,the -} opposite. They'll

350
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,060
0,90 90,315 315,555 555,830
say let everything go.|

351
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,290
0,335 335,560 560,710 710,860 860,1010
And in the end I

352
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,670
0,135 135,410 670,960 960,1185 1185,1380
will check if something is

353
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,840
0,525 525,690 690,855 855,1020 1020,1170
unsafe. {I,know -} how to

354
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,875
0,150 150,345 345,510 510,615 615,1035
back out of the unsafe

355
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,900
0,245
parts.|

356
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,370
0,290 290,635 635,910 1350,1655 1655,1850
And locking says if two

357
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,240
0,180 180,345 345,510 510,645 645,870
things are trying to conflict

358
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,260
0,240 240,375 375,555 555,795 795,1020
with each other, oh, they

359
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,445
0,195 195,500 520,795 795,975 975,1185
will probably do bad things.

360
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,600
0,165 165,300 300,480 480,785 865,1155
{Let,me -} stop them at

361
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,460
0,240 240,590 1060,1380 1380,1695 1695,1860
first {touch.,So -} that's what

362
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,530
0,150 150,285 285,480 480,735 735,1070
we will talk about today,

363
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,340
0,380 380,760 900,1300 1350,2230
the lock based pessimistic.|

364
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
0,525 525,750 750,1430
Conccy control mechanisms.|

365
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,690
0,290 290,455 455,590 590,725 725,1000
So what does it mean?|

366
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,630
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,855 855,1290
You've played around with latches,

367
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,350
0,195 195,330 330,450 450,585 585,720
which you did in your

368
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,445
0,180 180,435 435,675 675,870 870,1095
very first c plus plus

369
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,510
0,450 450,600 600,765 765,930 930,1065
assignment. {At,that -} time, you

370
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,790
0,195 195,570 570,690 690,915 915,1280
were protecting a data structure

371
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,160
0,320 320,640 930,1235 1235,1540 1650,2050
in {memory.,You -} put a

372
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,735
0,400 780,1055 1055,1280 1280,1600 2010,2285
mechanism, the latch mechanism, so

373
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:10,755
0,180 180,420 420,750 750,855 855,1020
that two threads, if they're

374
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:12,195
0,135 135,285 285,435 435,725 1135,1440
trying to make changes that

375
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,290
0,195 195,465 465,750 750,900 900,1095
would have destroyed the data

376
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,175
0,315 315,555 555,675 675,780 780,885
structure, left it in a

377
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,740
0,285 285,605 685,990 990,1290 1290,1565
{corrupt,state. -} That doesn't happen.|

378
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,800
0,345 345,620 730,1005 1005,1185 1185,1380
Locks do the same thing

379
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
0,165 165,330 330,620 670,1070
but for database stuff.|

380
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,865
0,240 240,540 540,1005 1005,1230 1230,1365
And what locks the way

381
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,930
0,150 150,300 300,555 555,855 855,1065
you would do things with

382
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,145
0,315 315,560 610,960 960,1140 1140,1215
locks is imagine I have

383
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,195
0,120 120,395 445,705 705,885 885,1050
a schedule where I'm reading

384
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,580
0,195 195,420 420,755 835,1110 1110,1385
and writing objects. {So,here -}

385
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,795
0,290 290,580 960,1265 1265,1570 1710,1985
you see two transactions t

386
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,775
0,150 150,330 985,1335 1335,1575 1575,1830
1 t 2 what we'll

387
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,280
0,150 150,360 360,540 540,815
do is we will.|

388
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,660
0,225 225,770
Put locks.|

389
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,890
0,320 320,530 530,755 755,995 995,1190
Before we read or write

390
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,555
0,150 150,410 880,1155 1155,1350 1350,1665
an object, we will acquire

391
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,740
0,225 225,485
the lock.|

0,320 320,500 500,760 840,1240 1470,1775
Before we make that read

393
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,180
0,195 195,480 480,875
or write operation.|

0,300 300,510 510,780 780,915 915,1035
Okay, and locks will come

395
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,430
0,120 120,345 345,695 715,1080 1080,1215

to that in a {second.,For

397

-} now, just assume before

398
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,225
0,195 195,405 405,725 865,1140 1140,1350
we read a we will

399
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,455
0,240 240,405 405,665 835,1095 1095,1230
apply the lock and as

400
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,320
0,135 135,300 300,605 1225,1545 1545,1865
you see transaction t one

401
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,590
0,290 290,455 455,725 725,1010 1010,1190
as it goes a bit

402
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,210
0,255 255,620 880,1245 1245,1470 1470,1620
further down, after it is

403
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,185
0,210 210,405 405,600 600,810 810,975
done with all the stuff

404
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,300
0,150 150,390 390,615 615,795 795,1115
it needed to make changes

405
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,975
0,380 380,635 635,910 960,1250 1250,1625
to the lock, it doesn't

406
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:57,610
0,390 390,875 955,1260 1260,1455 1455,1635
didn't unlock pretty much like

407
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,035
0,165 165,360 360,465 465,740 1090,1425
what we've been using with

408
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,740
0,210 210,750 750,1115
the latches in.|

409

0,275 275,395 395,590 590,890 890,1085
And the data structures you

410
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,110
0,120 120,285 285,510 510,845 955,1245

0,480 480,630 630,810 810,975 975,1185
similarly, t two will follow

412
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,100
0,210 210,390 390,965 1195,1500 1500,1805
that same protocol. {And,so -}

413
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,320
0,400 630,1040 1040,1300

414
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,240
0,350 350,700 1020,1325 1325,1715 1715,1880

0,240 240,620
data structure.|

0,165 165,420 420,615 615,950 1180,1580
And it's going to get

417
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,925
0,395 395,650 650,940 1110,1505 1505,1625

0,120 120,270 270,465 465,555 555,645

0,90 90,240 240,540 540,990 990,1155
a little bit, it'll also

0,225 225,405 405,585 585,780 780,975
We won't get into the

0,210 210,360 360,510 510,660 660,840
details of what that lock

0,245 445,720 720,870 870,1005 1005,1335

0,255 255,405 405,585 585,890 1150,1485

0,180 180,315 315,480 480,750 750,1115
about the lock data structure.

00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:53,640
0,165 165,300 300,465 465,965

0,255 255,525 525,885 885,1020 1020,1310
Okay, so it's a structure

446
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,040
0,335 335,470 470,605 605,785 785,1040
that's going to keep track

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,390
0,210 210,360 360,830 880,1185 1185,1350
of the locks. {And,then -}

0,255 255,495 495,765 765,1145 1195,1595
example, that second lock request

0,245 245,425 425,530 530,635 635,770
so that's what the lock

454
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,815
0,270 270,525 525,765 765,1140 1140,1335

0,255 255,435 435,725 925,1200 1200,1320
point in time when the

0,180 180,300 300,525 525,890 1060,1350
you can just assume these

will process, and the lock

476
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,000

478
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:44,645
0,150 150,315 315,450 450,690 690,960
talk about these different lock

0,150 150,315 315,480 480,600 600,1080
We talk about the protocol

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
0,225 225,420 420,630 630,1160
called two phase locking.|

0,275 275,425 425,545 545,695 695,875

0,210 210,530 640,960 960,1185 1185,1490
how we get around that.

0,240 240,375 375,525 525,735 735,1055
so that it never happens.|

0,195 195,330 330,420 420,945 945,1250
So it's the programmer's responsibility.|

591
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,165
0,380 380,650 650,800 800,1055 1055,1295
Database guys are nice. {We,actually

0,350 400,660 660,780 780,915 915,1050
mechanism so that if that

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,165
0,210 210,420 420,555 555,735 735,1005

0,270 270,450 450,615 615,780 780,1055

0,270 270,600 600,840 840,1005 1005,1185
And typically when you're using

0,425 425,560 560,785 785,1445 1445,1925
Locks have these inbuilt deadlock

0,225 225,375 375,855 855,1110 1110,1605
And the mechanisms for deadlocks,

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,460
0,365 365,560 560,910 1110,1385 1385,1520
What's the difference between the?|

684
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,975
0,275 275,550 600,1025 1025,1205 1205,1475
They are protecting very different

685
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,430
0,300 300,635 715,1065 1065,1305 1305,1455
things. {So,think -} about the

686
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,600
0,165 165,390 390,705 705,1035 1035,1170
lock {manager.,It's -} protecting an

687
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,300
0,180 180,465 465,860 1120,1520
in memory structure, yeah.|

688
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,900
0,365 365,695 695,980 980,1220 1220,1490
And the lock manager is

689
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,280
0,405 405,555 555,795 795,1125 1125,1380
protecting the record a and

690
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,380
0,240 240,590 970,1335 1335,1700 1810,2100
record b that is, in

691
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,430
0,135 135,435 435,675 675,915 915,1050
the buffer pool. {It,may -}

692
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,405
0,120 120,465 465,720 720,855 855,975
get evicted and go on

693
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:13,200
0,255 255,360 360,480 480,615 615,795
disk, but the lock is

694
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,220
0,165 165,440
still held.|

695
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,470
0,255 255,405 405,680 700,975 975,1250
Till the transaction is done.|

696
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,140
0,400
Okay.|

697
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,480
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,785 785,1100
And now there's a related

698
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,800
0,330 330,555 555,825 825,1140 1140,1320
question is like, when do

699
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,450
0,165 165,495 495,720 720,1070 1360,1650
these locks get acquired a

700
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,640
0,270 270,480 480,630 630,870 870,1190
latch? When you acquire you

701
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,970
0,530 530,605 605,710 710,1115 1115,1310
explicitly as a programmer writing

702
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,930
0,165 165,360 360,555 555,705 705,960
a code to say, acquire

703
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,450
0,225 225,560 760,1035 1035,1215 1215,1520
this latch in this mode?|

704
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,820
0,455 455,590 590,845 845,1090 1260,1610
Locks, as we'll see, get

705
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,020
0,350
acquired.|

706
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,870
0,890 890,1010 1010,1130 1130,1390 1410,1810
Implicitly by the database system,

707
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,055
0,335 335,815 815,1130 1130,1400 1400,1715
and you're in very rare

708
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:36,960
0,365 595,1125 1125,1230 1230,1365 1365,1905
cases, explicitly as a programmer

709
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,550
0,150 150,585 585,1110 1110,1380 1380,1590
in sql specifying grab this

710
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,380
0,290
lock.|

711
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,865
0,260 260,380 380,800 800,935 935,1025
And the simplest way you

712
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,215
0,240 240,540 540,845 895,1155 1155,1350
can understand that if you're

713
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:43,240
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,675 675,1025
locking at the page level.|

714
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,555
0,400 750,1040 1040,1340 1340,1475 1475,1625
Is your buffer pool that

715
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,160
0,150 150,425 835,1200 1200,1425 1425,1605
you wrote imagine the call

716
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,135
0,165 165,255 255,525 525,690 690,975
to the buffer pool also

717
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,830
0,395 475,795 795,1115 1255,1530 1530,1695
said, hey, please identify which

718
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,075
0,290 370,630 630,855 855,1095 1095,1245
transaction you are. {One,more -}

719
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,590
0,515 775,1065 1065,1245 1245,1395 1395,1515
{parameter.,And -} oh by the

720
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,505
0,150 150,345 345,555 555,765 765,915
way, tell me whether you

721
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,405
0,105 105,225 225,390 390,645 645,900
are a read lock or

722
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,220
0,305 325,735 735,1115 1285,1605 1605,1815
a exclusive lock, in which

723
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,515
0,290 400,690 690,1190 1450,1850 1960,2295
case the buffer manager called

724
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,000
0,195 195,300 300,545 685,1085 1135,1485
to the page can itself

725
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,185
0,285 285,525 525,705 705,930 930,1185
go and make the request

726
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:02,145
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,660 660,960
to the lock manager on

727
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,800
0,335 355,645 645,810 810,1085 1255,1655
behalf of the transactions work.|

728
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,330
0,345 345,615 615,780 780,915 915,1050
So that is at the

729
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,230
0,195 195,450 450,630 630,735 735,900
page level. {At,the -} record

730
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,240
0,225 225,390 390,555 555,735 735,1010
level, it gets more {complicated.,But

731
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,350
0,275 275,485 485,575 575,665 665,910
-} that's how a database

732
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,265
0,305 305,610 870,1190 1190,1510 1530,1895
is written, is that at

733
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,500
0,365 385,705 705,885 885,990 990,1235
appropriate points where the data

734
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,220
0,260 260,520 720,995 995,1415 1415,1700
access happen, the locking request

735
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,165
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,720 720,945
will be in built {into,that.

736
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,110
0,245 295,570 570,705 705,825 825,945
-} So you as a

737
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,490
0,260 310,945 945,1155 1155,1260 1260,1380
database programmer don't have to

738
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,525
0,165 165,450 450,720 720,870 870,1035
put lock request all {over,your

739
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,235
0,165 165,425 595,870 870,1145 1165,1710
-} code. The right abstraction

740
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:19,955
0,150 150,300 300,435 435,555 555,720
will take care of putting

741
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:21,320
0,180 180,405 405,755
in that request.|

742
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,640
0,275 275,395 395,560 560,815 815,1010
And the page level stuff

743
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,830
0,120 120,240 240,585 585,825 825,1190
is the easiest to understand

744
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,755
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,665 665,845
because you guys have written

745
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:25,580
0,150 150,420 420,600 600,735 735,825
a buffer pool so you

746
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,315
0,120 120,255 255,405 405,570 570,735
can see how that would

747
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:26,920
0,275
work.|

748
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,415
0,335 335,605 605,860 860,1070 1070,1205
Okay, record level would go

749
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,390
0,90 90,255 255,510 510,765 765,975
a little bit below at

750
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,055
0,270 270,540 540,830 1060,1425 1425,1665
the access path for the

751
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:31,970
0,255 255,495 495,615 615,765 765,915
record when you get to

752
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,560
0,105 105,350 760,1125 1125,1380 1380,1590
the file and as you're

753
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,730
0,150 150,345 345,510 510,900 900,1170
writing all this insert calls

754
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,705
0,225 225,450 450,675 675,825 825,975
and other stuff in this

755
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,175
0,275 505,780 780,1035 1035,1320 1320,1470
project, you will start to

756
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,150
0,165 165,345 345,510 510,720 720,975
think about it like, oh,

757
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,040
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,600 600,890
if I had a transaction

758
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
0,400 420,820 900,1145 1145,1265 1265,1400
management system, which is by

759
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,420
0,105 105,225 225,495 495,765 765,900
the way, coming as the

760
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,770
0,180 180,500 790,1080 1080,1230 1230,1350
next project, where would I

761
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,670
0,135 135,375 375,615 615,765 765,900
put it? It would be

762
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,500
0,135 135,270 270,390 390,540 540,830
at one of these levels,

763
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,620
0,400
okay?|

764
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,680
0,335 335,670
Other questions?|

765
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,960
0,305 305,610
All right.|

766
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,820
0,350 850,1185 1185,1425 1425,1680 1680,1860
So we already started to

767
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,455
0,300 300,540 540,830 910,1455 1455,1635
allude towards that locks come

768
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:55,790
0,165 165,360 360,615 615,885 885,1335
in at least two flavors,

769
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,080
0,120 120,210 210,390 390,710
there are many more.|

770
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,420
0,165 165,405 405,735 735,1020 1020,1340
A shared lock that says

771
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,785
0,410 410,620 620,970 1320,1670 1670,1955
I'm reading a someone else

772
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,585
0,255 255,435 435,600 1315,1590 1590,1800
wants to read AI don't

773
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,520
0,245
care.|

774
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,610
0,210 210,615 615,765 765,1520 1690,2090
The sharedlock is compatible with

775
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,440
0,335 335,970 1080,1480 2190,2495 2495,2780
another sharedlock and this is

776
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,960
0,240 240,885 885,1610 1750,2150 2170,2520
the compatibility matrix and as

777
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,100
0,345 345,540 540,870 870,1080 1080,1140
we'll see sometimes there are

778
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,680
0,90 90,285 285,620 910,1245 1245,1580
a lot more lock types

779
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,150
0,305 305,485 485,695 695,1010 1010,1420
besides a shared and exclusive

780
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,065
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,1175 1175,1685
and so this compatibility matrix

781
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,700
0,210 210,435 435,755 1165,1440 1440,1635
can get bigger. {And,all -}

0,165 165,315 315,510 510,660 660,795

0,195 195,495 495,615 615,890
lock modes in there.|

0,120 120,240 240,375 375,510 510,660
All of that is to

allow more parallelism.|

0,195 195,450 450,705 705,825 825,975
And make everything we talk

864
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:06,760
0,240 240,450 450,705 705,1035 1035,1305

0,320 1300,1590 1590,1860 1860,2190 2190,2475
So, but the first idea

866
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,045
0,225 225,390 390,555 555,690 690,810
is like, how do we

867

0,195 195,420 420,555 555,705 705,885
So let's start on that

869
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,725
0,270 270,635 835,1235 1285,1605 1605,1800

0,180 180,345 345,510 510,795 795,1055
just two lock modes now.|

871
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,595
0,400 570,970 1230,1550 1550,1870 2850,3185
Alright, so we will have

872
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:21,780
0,335 625,990 990,1595

0,290 290,455 455,665 665,980 980,1295
And this is also notion

874
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,010
0,225 225,515 535,885 885,1065 1065,1275
of lock upgrades, which you're

0,255 255,540 540,720 720,900 900,1050

0,290 340,600 600,720 720,975 975,1170

0,165 165,465 465,615 615,750 750,900

0,150 150,330 330,450 450,645 645,980
looking at the page level,

881
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,240
0,275 275,455 455,710 710,995 995,1190
you ask a request for

882
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,245
0,120 120,345 345,570 570,690 690,1005
a page in a sql

883
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,925
0,305 685,1085 1135,1410 1410,1545 1545,1680
query and, you know, in

884
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,945
0,275 295,615 615,795 795,915 915,1020
an application that is a

885
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,070
0,285 285,495 495,690 690,840 840,1125
sql query that just scans

886
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,360
0,285 285,450 450,710 880,1155 1155,1290
all the {records.,And -} then

887
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,580
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,740 790,1220
maybe in the next query

888
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,925
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,940 1020,1295
in that same transaction, it

889
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:44,765
0,150 150,330 330,435 435,630 630,840
says I'm going to update

890
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:45,635
0,180 180,315 315,435 435,645 645,870
some of the records I

891
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:46,280
0,275
saw.|

892
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,675
0,180 180,470 610,960 960,1215 1215,1395
Right, so grab all the

893
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,220
0,240 240,605 775,1140 1140,1395 1395,1545
student records. {Oh,,and -} for

894
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,905
0,165 165,470 850,1250 1990,2385 2385,2685
the students that have a

895
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,075
0,305 475,750 750,885 885,1005 1005,1170
b, make it a b

896
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,215
0,285 285,570 570,705 705,945 945,1140
plus, right? So it's only

897
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,190
0,225 225,450 450,690 690,855 855,975
going to update some of

0,120 120,380 670,960 960,1155 1155,1440
the records that it scanned

899
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,905
0,90 90,195 195,405 405,770 1000,1275
in the first one, so

900
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:00,005
0,120 120,365 655,1055 1195,1595 1675,2100
the first, first, first query,

901
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:00,845
0,330 330,450 450,600 600,735 735,840
it's all part of the

902
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,830
0,150 150,455 1105,1410 1410,1650 1650,1985
same {transaction.,May -} just issue

903
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,390
0,425 425,680 680,890 890,1100 1100,1390
requests to fetch in pages

904
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,330
0,245 245,335 335,605 605,755 755,890
to the buffer pool if

905
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,580
0,180 180,300 300,510 510,750 750,1250
you're doing page level locking

906
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,525
0,320 320,560 560,880 900,1295 1295,1715
and just grab read locks

907
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,300
0,150 150,455
on it.|

908
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,185
0,210 210,375 375,555 555,705 705,885
But then some of those

909
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:11,420
0,285 285,555 555,765 765,960 960,1235
pages in which the records

910
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,870
0,365 365,620 620,800 800,1090 1170,1430
of interest are present, you

911
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,470
0,135 135,255 255,345 345,465 465,600
want to go and make

912
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,940
0,135 135,410 640,975 975,1215 1215,1470
it a write lock, an

913
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,275
0,360 360,735 735,990 990,1200 1200,1335
exclusive lock. {So,that's -} called

914
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,865
0,135 135,395 415,845 1075,1395 1395,1590
a lock {upgrade.,When -} the

0,270 270,510 510,785 1165,1470 1470,1755
query is running, you don't

916
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,490
0,180 180,465 465,570 570,675 675,870
know what's going to happen

917
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,540
0,350
next.|

918
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,320
0,275 275,590 590,875 875,1190 1190,1490
When you're creating that operation

919
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,220
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,690 690,900
to read the page, you

920
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,165
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,750 750,945

-} to read it because

922
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,400
0,150 150,300 300,525 525,860 1060,1320
I'm a select {query.,The -}

923
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,330
0,165 165,315 315,420 420,660 660,930
next way is an {update,query.

924
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,335
0,240 240,420 420,555 555,735 735,1005
-} Now it needs to

925
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:30,620
0,300 300,635
update stuff.|

926
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,135
0,255 255,560 880,1170 1170,1335 1335,1515
Right. {So,there -} are this

927
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,620
0,255 255,510 510,815 925,1290 1290,1485
notion of lock upgrades, which

928
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,330
0,120 120,225 225,330 330,450 450,710
is I as a transaction.|

929
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,880
0,290 290,455 455,650 650,815 815,920
Can have asked for a

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,825

00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,210
0,165 165,285 285,575 685,1035 1035,1385
I'm not asking it {directly.,Someone's

932
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,310

933
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,940
0,350 350,530 530,950 950,1070 1070,1280
I'm just disclosing what {my,operation

934
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,975
0,270 270,450 450,645 645,825 825,1035
-} is. I'm reading a

935
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,430
0,275 685,960 960,1080 1080,1335 1335,1455
file and the buffer pool

936
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,540
0,135 135,270 270,530 580,885 885,1110
in this case could be

937
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,890
0,315 315,585 585,750 750,1020 1020,1350
asking for read level page

0,530
locks.|

939
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
0,275 275,440 440,620 620,910 960,1360
And the update transaction says

940
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,605
0,350 350,500 500,695 695,920 920,1145
I'm getting this page from

941
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,430
0,105 105,345 345,495 495,660 660,825
the buffer pool, but oh,

942
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,955
0,150 150,255 255,330 330,435 435,525
by the way, I'm going

943
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:53,920
0,105 105,270 270,510 510,690 690,965
to change stuff on it,

944
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,540
0,290 290,580
so grab.|

945
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,445
0,410 410,790 810,1100 1100,1250 1250,1445
Exclusive lock at the page

947
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,600
0,255 255,510 510,645 645,825 825,1160
So in the same transaction.|

948
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,615
0,210 210,420 420,585 585,765 765,915
First, a call might come

949
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:02,610
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,660 660,995
back to that same object

0,135 135,270 270,435 435,740 850,1185
For a read lock and

952
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,640
0,270 270,525 525,735 735,900 900,1175
later on it may get

953
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,560
0,430 480,740 740,1000 1020,1445 1445,1840

0,260 260,500 500,830 830,1150 1410,1685
so those upgrades happen. {Everything,we

955
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,780

0,270 270,420 420,695 835,1140 1140,1365
We will largely ignore that,

959
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,700
0,195 195,360 360,525 525,675 675,810
but just want you to

960
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,370
0,260 430,735 735,1005 1005,1335 1335,1670

0,305 305,470 470,725 725,995 995,1100
and the log flow of

0,180 180,480 480,735 735,1020 1020,1350
the requests is getting made

0,150 150,300 300,480 480,785 955,1305

0,330 330,710 910,1580 1600,1875 1875,1995
some appropriate abstraction in the

966

0,245 265,665
database engine.|

967

0,165 165,270 270,375 375,525 525,750

that piece right? When you

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:45,925
0,150 150,315 315,480 480,630 630,795
then you start to see

980
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:47,275
0,305 385,780 780,1065 1065,1215 1215,1350
lock calls start to show

981
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,655
0,270 270,585 585,905 955,1260 1260,1380
up in specific places and

982
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:49,710
0,90 90,270 270,540 540,780 780,1055
it might say, you know,

983
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,265
0,380 380,605 605,800 800,1070 1070,1325
exclusive lock is too {strict.,Here,

984
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,975
0,305 505,810 810,1035 1035,1500 1500,1710
-} put this weaker form

985
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,235
0,270 270,630 630,930 930,1125 1125,1260
of exclusive lock because I

986
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,320
0,195 195,435 435,615 615,840 840,1085
know just what I'm doing

987
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,605
0,275 275,515 515,770 770,935 935,1085
and you already have some

988
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:57,925
0,450 450,750 750,960 960,1140 1140,1320
intuition for that type of

989
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:58,720
0,225 225,420 420,555 555,675 675,795
stuff right when you did

990
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,575
0,120 120,285 285,630 630,750 750,855
the lock coupling in the

991
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:00,400
0,165 165,485
b tree.|

992
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,740
0,180 180,420 420,770
It was like.|

993
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,925
0,290 290,470 470,650 650,1010 1010,1145
It was like latches at

994
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:03,945
0,180 180,485 505,765 765,885 885,1020
that time, but you could

995
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:04,665
0,135 135,255 255,375 375,525 525,720
see how you could let

996
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:05,655
0,180 180,345 345,585 585,810 810,990
go of something at some

997
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:07,320
0,305 445,765 765,1035 1035,1380 1380,1665
point and be okay with

998
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,105
0,210 210,420 420,780 780,1530 1530,1785
being quote unquote unsafe. {Because,,you

999
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:10,560
0,120 120,240 240,1035 1035,1305 1305,1455
-} know, semantically all you

1000
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,370
0,165 165,330 330,450 450,600 600,810
care about is the structure

1001
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,270
0,195 195,330 330,585 585,810 810,900
of the {tree.,So -} you

1002
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,050
0,195 195,315 315,435 435,585 585,780
didn't need to hold on

1003
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,970
0,165 165,360 360,680 1510,1755 1755,1920
to things for the {whole,time.

1004
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,500
0,320 580,825 825,1050 1050,1350 1350,1530
-} So it's tricks like

1005
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,745
0,225 225,450 450,660 660,930 930,1245
that that {get,played -} around.

1006
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:18,680
0,300 300,405 405,510 510,645 645,935
That's how you get this

1007
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,440
0,350 350,590 590,800 800,1240
explosion of lock modes.|

1008
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,860
0,400
Okay.|

1009
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,880
0,165 165,390 390,585 585,765 765,1020
But again, for now, we'll

1010
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,050
0,135 135,345 345,570 570,975 975,1170
just talk about locks in

1011
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,595
0,165 165,435 435,830 940,1260 1260,1545
that regular sense and lock

1012
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:27,400
0,315 315,635 745,1050 1050,1355 1405,1805
upgrades happen. {Lock,manager -} will

1013
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,420
0,400 480,830 830,1130 1130,1480 1620,1910
either grant the request or

1014
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,650
0,210 210,435 435,675 675,960 960,1230
not grant a request will

1015
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,630
0,165 165,360 360,525 525,690 690,980
play around with just these

1016
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,635
0,320 320,575 575,920 920,1480 1560,1925
shared and exclusive {locks.,And -}

1017
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,590
0,240 240,510 510,935 1375,1665 1665,1955
when an upgrade, when an

1018
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,770
0,290 290,515 515,755 755,965 965,1130
when a request comes in,

1019
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,810
0,180 180,285 285,495 495,735 735,1040
it's going to update this

1020
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,650
0,440 440,695 695,1090 1320,1595 1595,1820
hash table structure, which is

1021
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,985
0,300 300,495 495,600 600,890 1060,1335
protected by a latch, to

1022
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:41,945
0,180 180,375 375,540 540,720 720,960
keep track of all the

1023
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,030
0,285 285,465 465,600 600,780 780,1085
requests that have been granted

1024
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,240
0,275 275,440 440,650 650,890 890,1040
and all the requests that

1025
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,100
0,120 120,560
are pending.|

1026
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,245
0,400 630,1030 1080,1385 1385,1655 1655,1775
Alright, so now let's go

1027
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,180
0,275 325,570 570,750 750,1085
back to our example.|

1028
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,295
0,275 275,440 440,605 605,740 740,935
We now have two different

1029
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:52,740
0,225 225,390 390,875
types of locks.|

1030
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,110
0,225 225,390 390,680 790,1080 1080,1370
So on transaction t one,

1031
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,275
0,365 365,500 500,755 755,1010 1010,1145
it's not making just a

1032
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:56,205
0,225 225,495 495,705 705,810 810,930
lock request. {It's,going -} to

1033
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:57,210
0,180 180,420 420,615 615,780 780,1005
say I have an X

1034
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,455
0,330 330,675 675,900 900,1065 1065,1245
lock request because I'm making

1035
00:25:58,455 --> 00:25:59,385
0,315 315,540 540,630 630,780 780,930
changes to {it.,I'm -} an

1036
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:00,600
0,225 225,545
update query.|

1037
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,905
0,225 225,450 450,585 585,1065 1065,1305
And then it unlocks it.

1038
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:04,100
0,585 585,875 985,1275 1275,1565 1795,2195
{Similarly,,transaction -} t two has

1039
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,180
0,275 275,485 485,800 800,1180 1590,1880
an X lock {request.,The -}

1040
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,965
0,290 370,735 735,1035 1035,1370 1480,1785
second request from transaction t

1041
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,525
0,305 535,840 840,1005 1005,1230 1230,1560
one is a shared lock

1042
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,590
0,255 255,420 420,645 645,885 885,1065
request for a, because all

1043
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,430
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,630 630,840
it is doing is reading

1044
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,120
0,320
it.|

1045
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,710
0,290 290,560 560,830 830,1325 1325,1460
So now our protocols are

1046
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,880
0,255 255,600 600,855 855,1005 1005,1170
slightly different. {We,are -} not

1047
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,630
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,585 585,750
just going to say lock

1048
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,980
0,530 580,855 855,1005 1005,1140 1140,1350
unlock, but we're also going

1049
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,345
0,135 135,270 270,465 465,770 1090,1365
to say which {type.,And -}

1050
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,590
0,165 165,390 390,635 655,990 990,1245
then reads are we shared

1051
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,790
0,285 285,390 390,885 885,1020 1020,1200
locks are compatible with shared

1052
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,885
0,390 390,585 585,705 705,855 855,1095
locks and the lock manager

1053
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:22,995
0,195 195,360 360,660 660,945 945,1110
is going to make all

1054
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,560
0,210 210,480 480,735 735,1170 1170,1565
that grant and {blocking,requests. -}

1055
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
0,400 420,695 695,905 905,1600 1710,2000
Okay, {so,pretty -} straightforward. No

1056
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,560
0,290 550,855 855,1160
magic so far.|

1057
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,680
0,365 365,700
Yup, question.|

1058
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,990
0,275 275,440 440,605 605,770 770,920
We will do that in

1059
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,790
0,120 120,380 640,930 930,1220 1510,1800
a second. {We,will. {-},So -}

1060
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,065
0,195 195,500 670,945 945,1080 1080,1275
right now, this is {not,correct.

1061
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,520
0,335 775,1020 1020,1140 1140,1350 1350,1455
-} So if that's what

1062
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,405
0,150 150,300 300,495 495,630 630,885
you're thinking is like, hey,

1063
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,085
0,585 585,705 705,840 840,1115 1255,1680
didlocks {make,it -} work. That's

1064
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:42,990
0,240 240,450 450,555 555,645 645,905
exactly {what,we -} are saying.

1065
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,635
0,305 305,635 635,910 1050,1325 1325,1475
This doesn't mean if you

1066
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:45,760
0,165 165,375 375,570 570,975 975,1125
just follow that protocol I

1067
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,420
0,150 150,300 300,405 405,525 525,660
told you, which is not

1068
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,545
0,135 135,270 270,705 705,930 930,1125
yet a protocol, right? Just

1069
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:48,900
0,120 120,365 445,765 765,1020 1020,1355
an idea saying lock stuff.|

1070
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
0,260 260,395 395,620 620,970
It is not correct.|

1071
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,205
0,315 315,540 540,675 675,810 810,1005
And we will make it

1072
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:53,230
0,210 210,345 345,450 450,660 660,1025
correct in a second. {So,over

1073
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,655
0,350 350,700 1140,1540 1680,2060 2060,2315
-} here is exactly the

1074
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,115
0,275 445,845 1225,1515 1515,1805 2125,2460
scenario where we have this

1075
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,900
0,335 415,810 810,1205 1285,1590 1590,1785
lock {request.,But -} see this

0,305 305,560 560,875 875,1175 1175,1510
And then that got read

1079
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,140
0,305 305,515 515,820 1140,1540
that got written by.|

1080
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,120
0,350 670,1005 1005,1340
The t two.|

1081
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,815
0,225 225,530 760,1065 1065,1305 1305,1695
And then t one reads

1082
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:12,840
0,275 865,1265 1285,1605 1605,1815 1815,2025
back what t two wrote.

1083
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,845
0,195 195,470 520,780 780,885 885,1005
{So,obviously -} now if you

1084
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:15,510
0,135 135,300 300,660 660,965 1375,1665
draw the dependence graph, we

1085
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,785
0,180 180,375 375,540 540,800 970,1275
have formed the cycle, right?

1086
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:17,930
0,240 240,345 345,510 510,780 780,1145
There's a write write request.|

1087
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,650
0,305 305,470 470,650 650,740 740,890
And then there's a write

1088
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,040
0,285 285,680
read request.|

1089

0,400 840,1240 1590,1895 1895,2090 2090,2380
And we have a schedule

1090
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,000
0,290 290,470 470,760
that is not.|

00:27:26,755 --> 00:27:28,555

0,90 90,255 255,540 540,750 750,930
a {bad,schedule. -} We don't

1094
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,295
0,120 120,285 285,465 465,645 645,810
want {to,allow -} this. This

1095
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,125
0,275 385,735 735,960 960,1235 1555,1830
is leaves the database in

1096
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,640
0,150 150,630 630,935
an incorrect state.|

1097
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,990
0,305 305,610 690,950 950,1115 1115,1280
Okay, so we want to

1098
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,020
0,165 165,470
stop that.|

1099
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,605
0,290 290,580 600,1055 1055,1175 1175,1385
So now locks are not

1100
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:38,640
0,335
enough.|

1101
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
0,165 165,270 270,360 360,620
But they are necessary.|

1102
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,490
0,260 260,395 395,560 560,800 800,1040
We need a little bit

1103
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,440
0,290
more.|

1104
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,355
0,210 210,360 360,525 525,720 720,915
And we need this thing

1105
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,440
0,305 325,645 645,915 915,1505 1795,2085
called two phase locking. {And,this

1106
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,480
0,180 180,470 670,975 975,1640 1750,2040
-} was a breakthrough when

1107
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,380
0,135 135,285 285,525 525,735 735,900
the whole theory of two

0,225 225,770 880,1215 1215,1500 1500,1800
phase locking came {about.,Jim -}

1109
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,140

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,230
0,420 420,710 730,1110 1110,1490 1690,2090
IBM folks {invented,that. -} And,

1111
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,725
0,290 290,440 440,620 620,815 815,1085
you know, Jim gray got

1112
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:55,940
0,285 285,630 630,840 840,1020 1020,1215
{a,Turing -} award. A large

1113
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,920
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,690 690,980
part of that was based

1114
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,625
0,290 290,470 470,665 665,970 1320,1595
on this one paper in

1115
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,375
0,150 150,285 285,465 465,645 645,750
which he talks about the

1116
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,365
0,165 165,420 420,630 630,780 780,990
whole theory of two phase

1117
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:01,790
0,435 435,725 745,1050 1050,1260 1260,1425
locking and the strict two

1118
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,705
0,165 165,450 450,570 570,765 765,915
phase locking, which we'll talk

1119
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:03,560
0,165 165,300 300,420 420,570 570,855
about in a little bit,

1120
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,925
0,285 285,510 510,1065 1065,1215 1215,1365
and lock hierarchies and all

1121
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,010
0,135 135,255 255,450 450,735 735,1085
of that other fun stuff.|

1122
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,210
0,290 290,455 455,650 650,1150 1410,1810
So two, phase locking is

1123
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,620
0,400 630,1330 1620,1970 1970,2195 2195,2360
a protocol that we need

1124
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,290
0,165 165,360 360,680 1060,1365 1365,1670
to start following to make

1125
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,805
0,605 605,940 1080,1480 1710,1970 1970,2135
locks actually work to give

1126
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:17,985
0,225 225,545 805,1740 1740,2045 2545,3180
us the serializable schedule semantics

1127
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:19,040
0,150 150,300 300,575
that we want.|

1128
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,040
0,400 870,1205 1205,1310 1310,1430 1430,1690
So we'll do the following.

1129
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,270
0,275 275,485 485,830 830,1385 1385,1640
{We,will -} acquire {locks.,There -}

1130
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,245
0,135 135,285 285,510 510,735 735,975
was no problem with that

1131
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,150
0,270 270,575 955,1290 1290,1590 1590,1905
{so,far. -} We must acquire

1132
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,155
0,315 315,495 495,630 630,765 765,1005
locks before we make changes

1133
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:29,520
0,225 225,330 330,575
to the objects.|

1134
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,065
0,240 240,390 390,645 645,1040 1270,1545
But the problem was when

1135
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,205
0,195 195,450 450,660 660,960 960,1140
we acquired the logs, we

1136
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,195
0,225 225,435 435,615 615,795 795,990
let go of it too

1137
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,700
0,305 775,1175 1345,1745 1885,2205 2205,2505
soon and others could start

1138
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,160
0,380 610,1290 1290,1580 1930,2205 2205,2460
seeing incorrect data. {The,problem -}

1139
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,010
0,330 330,645 645,1010 1270,1560 1560,1850
was not that we have

1140
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,175
0,335 335,665 665,770 770,890 890,1055
these locks in the wrong

1141
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:42,015
0,180 180,315 315,495 495,690 690,840
{place.,The -} problem is this

1142
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:43,620
0,390 390,555 555,845 985,1350 1350,1605
unlock of a happened too

1143
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,105
0,290 520,885 885,1110 1110,1275 1275,1485
soon and we could start

1144
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,650
0,165 165,300 300,575 595,995 1255,1545
to see this, ah, the

1145
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,105
0,290 400,690 690,960 960,1245 1245,1455
transaction t two could start

1146
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:49,410
0,180 180,330 330,605 895,1170 1170,1305
pick up changes of the

1147
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,460
0,260 310,555 555,675 675,825 825,1050
transaction that has not yet

1148
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,200
0,350
committed.|

1149
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,400
0,275 275,515 515,650 650,830 830,1070
So that's what two phase

1150
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,650
0,390 390,525 525,720 720,945 945,1250
locking is going to solve

1151
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,340
0,290 290,470 470,800 800,1040 1040,1310
and saying we break up

1152
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,860
0,350 520,900 900,1125 1125,1260 1260,1520
all requests from a transaction

1153
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,600
0,305 305,485 485,970
in two phases.|

1154
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,670
0,225 225,330 330,465 465,705 705,1070
One is a growing phase

1155
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,820
0,290 290,455 455,590 590,710 710,860
in which they can keep

1156
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,900
0,290 310,660 660,825 825,915 915,1080
making requests to the lock

1157
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,965
0,320 370,645 645,795 795,915 915,1065
manager is as a lock

1158
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:03,850
0,255 255,450 450,585 585,720 720,885
manager is going to keep

1159
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,530
0,320 460,860 910,1200 1200,1440 1440,1680
track transaction. {T,one -} has

1160
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,670
0,165 165,360 360,615 615,870 870,1140
made a request making more

1161
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,680
0,285 285,525 525,720 720,1010 1690,2010
{request.,Stuff -} {like,that. -} The

1162
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,690
0,320 400,800 1120,1485 1485,1785 1785,2010
minute transaction starts to make

1163
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,730
0,210 210,530 580,1245 1245,1640 1690,2040
and {first,unlock -} request. I'm

1164
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,530
0,105 105,240 240,360 360,510 510,800
going to throw a flag

1165
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,040
0,305 305,485 485,665 665,950 950,1220
in my lock manager and

1166
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,525
0,165 165,330 330,620 850,1200 1200,1485
say {t,one -} has left.

1167
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:17,620
0,210 210,435 435,705 705,930 930,1095
The growing phase is now

1168
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,960
0,135 135,270 270,585 585,860
in the shrinking phase.|

1169
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,430
0,380 380,590 590,860 860,1085 1085,1570
It's starting to release locks

1170
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,110
0,210 210,420 420,915 915,1220 1750,2100
2 phase protocol says once

1171
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,205
0,240 240,450 450,615 615,735 735,1095
you go into the shrinking

1172
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,675
0,305 535,810 810,990 990,1230 1230,1470
phase, you are not allowed

1173
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:27,530
0,150 150,330 330,525 525,690 690,855
to ask for any more

1174
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,480
0,440
locks.|

1175
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,635
0,260 260,380 380,560 560,725 725,875
If you ask for any

1176
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,920
0,180 180,665
more locks.|

1177
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,060
0,240 240,390 390,615 615,885 885,1140
The lock manager will reject

1178
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,275
0,320 370,615 615,720 720,885 885,1215
it. {You,have -} to abort

1179
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:34,565
0,195 195,485 595,915 915,1125 1125,1290
the transaction and start all

1180
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:35,480
0,275
over.|

1181
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,000
0,400 750,1025 1025,1175 1175,1325 1325,1520
So why does it work?

1182
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,215
0,240 240,525 525,765 765,1050 1050,1215
First, let's see. {What,does -}

1183
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,380
0,180 180,485
that mean?|

1184
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,880
0,275 275,550 1080,1385 1385,1690
If I look at.|

1185
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,885
0,275 275,455 455,635 635,755 755,965
The life of a single

1186
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:45,070
0,365 505,765 765,900 900,1050 1050,1185
transaction, which is what is

1187
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,320
0,180 180,500
shown here.|

1188
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,085
0,260 260,365 365,440 440,530 530,755
And this is a single

1189
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,855
0,365 955,1245 1245,1455 1455,1650 1650,1770
transaction with time on the

1190
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,220
0,135 135,695
X axis.|

1191
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,855
0,395 395,650 650,785 785,920 920,1085
Y access is the number

1192
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:52,650
0,180 180,450 450,555 555,675 675,795
of locks. {As,you -} can

1193
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,805
0,135 135,270 270,510 510,885 885,1155
{see.,The -} first phase where

1194
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:55,245
0,120 120,330 330,690 690,960 960,1440
it is growing the locks,

1195
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,910
0,420 420,705 705,1080 1080,1365 1365,1665
it's acquiring locks, {acquiring,locks. -}

1196
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,840
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,675 675,930
You know, maybe that read

1197
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,770
0,285 285,465 465,600 600,735 735,930
request has come in the

1198
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,960
0,195 195,500 850,1250 1510,1830 1830,2190
select query and it reaches

1199
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,220
0,120 120,360 360,720 720,990 990,1260
a certain point and then

1200
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,270
0,300 300,555 555,750 750,885 885,1050
it stays with all those

1201
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,580
0,270 270,390 390,600 600,915 915,1310
locks and {then,starts -} dropping.

1202
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,270
0,260 260,365 365,545 545,1120 1170,1490
So it is shrinking in

1203
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,215
0,210 210,435 435,675 675,825 825,945
this space over here and

1204
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,570
0,165 165,360 360,795 795,1065 1065,1355
once it shrinks it cannot

1205
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,260
0,320 320,575 575,800 800,995 995,1220
go back up and start

1206
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,840
0,225 225,525 525,735 735,1190
to acquire new locks.|

1207
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,020
0,400
Okay.|

1208
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,260
0,290 700,1100 1420,1710 1710,1920 1920,2240
So for in this case.|

1209
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,620
0,350 350,700 930,1330
This point. Which?|

1210
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,925
0,350 460,735 735,945 945,1155 1155,1305
Is the point at which

1211
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,170
0,150 150,420 420,915 915,1080 1080,1245
it had grabbed all the

1212
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,265
0,240 240,390 390,630 630,885 885,1095
locks it needed is called

1213
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,560
0,165 165,360 360,695
the lock point.|

1214
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,050
0,255 255,435 435,600 600,1215 1215,1490
And it's this magical point,

1215
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,340
0,275 275,470 470,590 590,815 815,1150
which I'll come back to

1216
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,480
0,305 305,530 530,725 725,860 860,1120
in terms of what it,

1217
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,110
0,350 350,560 560,695 695,970 1230,1520
what, what it means in

1218
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,220
0,165 165,315 315,495 495,870 870,1110
terms of the dependence graph

1219
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,155
0,180 180,315 315,590 760,1370 1630,1935
that is getting induced behind

1220
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,200
0,165 165,425
the scenes.|

1221
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,315
0,335 335,530 530,665 665,815 815,965
So everyone with me so

1222
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,050
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,600 600,735
far as to what the

1223
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,190
0,390 390,600 600,795 795,945 945,1140
protocol is for two phase

1224
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,240
0,500
locking.|

1225
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,215
0,320 320,635 635,905 905,1180 1380,1715
Right. {So,we -} can go

1226
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,400
0,335 355,645 645,825 825,1020 1020,1185
up and then start to

1227
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,345
0,150 150,435 435,660 660,825 825,945
come {down.,So -} it's got

1228
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:42,490
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,695 745,1145
to look like a mountain

1229
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,910
0,290 290,455 455,905 905,1160 1160,1400
with {no,valleys. -} It cannot

1230
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,380
0,270 270,495 495,800
have this valley.|

1231
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,735
0,400 450,740 740,1010 1010,1280 1280,1475
Right, it cannot be. {I,start

1232
00:30:47,735 --> 00:30:49,300
0,305 415,780 780,1035 1035,1245 1245,1565
-} reaching that lock {point.,I

1233
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,600
0,290 290,500 500,770 770,1055 1055,1160
-} start dropping locks and

1234
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,320
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,540 540,720
I start to go {up,again.

1235
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,040
0,320 340,690 690,915 915,1190
-} Cannot do that.|

1236
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,835
0,105 105,225 225,390 390,570 570,795
That will cause us trouble,

1237
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,520
0,335 385,735 735,1085
cause cause trouble.|

1238
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,800
0,180 180,315 315,750 750,1005 1005,1280
And the intuition is the

1239
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,920
0,305 305,455 455,700 720,965 965,1070
is the following. {This,is -}

1240
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,840
0,120 120,285 285,590 1360,1665 1665,1920
a two phase two, pl

1241
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,700
0,590 670,945 945,1125 1125,1455 1455,1860
violation, two phase locking {violation.,The

1242
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,350
0,165 165,620 1090,1365 1365,1500 1500,1650
-} intuition, which I hope

1243
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,235
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,645 645,885
you can work out by

1244
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:05,840
0,335 565,930 930,1215 1215,1425 1425,1605
yourself is why does two

1245
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,700
0,225 225,630 630,920 1150,1620 1620,1860
phase locking work? It's because

1246
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,830
0,180 180,405 405,570 570,810 810,1130
if I've got two transactions.|

1247
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,275
0,270 270,390 390,585 585,890 970,1275
I'll go back to this

1248
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:12,430
0,305 385,660 660,855 855,975 975,1155
slide. {If,I've,got - -} two

1249
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,720
0,290 520,825 825,990 990,1125 1125,1290
transaction like this is one

1250
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,610
0,290 820,1155 1155,1490 1510,1770 1770,1890
transaction, another transaction will have

1251
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,120
0,135 135,315 315,570 570,920
its own curve, right?|

1252
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,035
0,290 290,580 750,1025 1025,1355 1355,1505
The transaction that reaches the

1253
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:21,045
0,240 240,555 555,905 1555,1845 1845,2010
lock point first is the

1254
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,700
0,210 210,435 435,615 615,905
one that will be.|

1255
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,770
0,400 600,1000 1020,1420 1530,1790 1790,1940
The first transaction in that

1256
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,040
0,290 670,1230 1230,1520
final serial schedule.|

1257
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,105
0,375 375,630 630,750 750,915 915,1065
So anyone who gets to

1258
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:28,915
0,135 135,285 285,510 510,630 630,810
all the locks they need,

1259
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:29,700
0,165 165,270 270,405 405,540 540,785
that they want to conflict

1260
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,700
0,365 365,575 575,725 725,830 830,980
with, so it's like, who

1261
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,525
0,195 195,390 390,570 570,720 720,825
reached the top of the

1262
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,330
0,195 195,545 625,1245 1245,1500 1500,1805
mountain first? I'm before you

1263
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,185
0,395 395,530 530,740 740,1060 1410,1775
that's going to determine the

1264
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,480
0,365
database.|

1265
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,190
0,400 480,785 785,995 995,1175 1175,1340
Update in terms of that

1266
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,840
0,660 660,950
serializable schedule.|

1267
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,270
0,275 275,425 425,695 695,800 800,1210
Okay, so that's the intuition,

1268
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,500
0,290 290,560 560,665 665,785 785,1060
and that's why it works.|

1269
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,460
0,400
Okay.|

1270
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,680
0,400
Question.|

1271
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,020
0,400
Yeah.|

1272
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,580
0,350 370,770
However you.|

1273
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,680
0,150 150,390 390,615 615,840 840,1080
Making sure that all these

1274
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,930
0,360 360,525 525,750 750,975 975,1250
ta will be the local.|

1275
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,130
0,395 395,785 785,1145 1145,1460 1460,1640
Yeah, so the, that's a

1276
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,050
0,270 270,585 585,980 1300,1620 1620,1920
great question. {So,the -} question

1277
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,070
0,360 360,615 615,765 765,885 885,1020
is how are we going

1278
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,570
0,210 210,530 700,1035 1035,1290 1290,1500
to allow t one from

1279
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,880
0,255 255,525 525,750 750,990 990,1310
reaching the lock point first?

1280
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,260
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,830 830,1150
We are not going to,

1281
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,890
0,400 690,1055 1055,1220 1220,1325 1325,1430
ah, here's what's going to

1282
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,610
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,585 585,720
happen. T 1 t two

1283
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,645
0,120 120,375 375,690 690,900 900,1035
can start doing the work

1284
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:14,800
0,245 505,780 780,915 915,1035 1035,1155
as we look at the

1285
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,655
0,120 120,450 450,585 585,705 705,855
protocol in a little bit

1286
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:18,420
0,305 745,1125 1125,1500 1500,1895 2365,2765
as soon as t one.

1287
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
0,400
|

1288
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,445
0,350 350,560 560,680 680,830 830,995
Either one of those t

1289
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,405
0,135 135,255 255,405 405,660 660,960
one or t two, either

1290
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:22,245
0,180 180,285 285,420 420,720 720,840
one of them reaches a

1291
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:23,655
0,150 150,360 360,665 955,1245 1245,1410
lock point first, that will

1292
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:24,555
0,135 135,240 240,450 450,705 705,900
be the order if t

1293
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,145
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,935 1255,1590
two reaches it first see

1294
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,090
0,270 270,465 570,690 690,825 825,945
imagine t 1 t two

1295
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,100
0,105 105,240 240,405 405,570 570,1010
are running in two threads.|

1296
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,895
0,225 225,390 390,540 540,825 825,1275
And they keep context switching

1297
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:31,275
0,210 210,480 480,735 735,1025 1105,1380
or something like that, right?

1298
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,205
0,150 150,285 285,435 435,600 600,930
And if t two reaches

1299
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:33,765
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,785 1105,1560
the lock point first, it'll

1300
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:34,800
0,105 105,330 330,570 570,810 810,1035
be like the final state

1301
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,715
0,120 120,240 240,495 495,765 765,915
of the database is t

1302
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:36,710
0,135 135,345 345,555 555,705 705,995

0,270 270,450 450,615 615,810 810,1035
So we can allow any

1304
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:40,460
0,630 630,1215 1215,1505
arbitrary interleaving now.|

1305
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,065
0,150 150,315 315,525 525,860 1330,1605
And as long as we

1306
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:43,420
0,225 225,420 420,555 555,765 765,1355
follow the two phase protocol,

1307
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,095
0,470 470,730 750,1115 1115,1490 1490,1625
doesn't matter. {Whoever,reaches -} that

1308
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,000
0,180 180,360 360,525 525,660 660,905
first is going to be

1309
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,590
0,305 305,470 470,605 605,980 980,1270
ahead in that serial schedule.|

1310
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,000
0,400
Okay.|

1311
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,080
0,290 290,530 530,650 650,845 845,1070
And that's the beauty is

1312
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,040
0,285 285,540 540,735 735,840 840,960

after the same database as

0,150 150,285 285,390 390,510 510,750

0,120 120,240 240,495 495,810 810,1035
Is it possible for t

0,400 420,770 770,890 890,1040 1040,1235
Yeah, we'll get to that.

1329
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,840
0,300 300,795 795,1020 1020,1505 1525,1815
{That,induces -} a deadlock and

0,285 285,480 480,690 690,1175 1675,1965
won't prevent a deadlock and

1332
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,785
0,120 120,225 225,705 705,900 900,1095
we have mechanisms to deal

1333
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:22,565

0,360 360,675 675,885 885,1175 1495,1785
So {hold,that -} question. If

1335
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,480
0,150 150,285 285,420 420,680 730,1130
they go in opposite order,

1336
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,500
0,410 410,605 605,965 965,1265 1265,1460
there's a case where two

1337
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,090
0,240 240,660 660,870 870,1190 1300,1590
phase locking can still end

1338
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,035
0,150 150,285 285,495 495,750 750,945
up with a situation and

1339
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,085
0,165 165,420 420,660 660,825 825,1050
{no,progress -} is made. That's

1340
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,045
0,135 135,495 495,600 600,795 795,960
called deadlocks, and we'll break

1341
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:32,700
0,305
it.|

1342
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,720
0,365 365,620 620,905 905,1300
Good, good thinking question.|

1343
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,955
0,290 290,440 440,560 560,710 710,875
Yeah, so the question is

1344
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:43,980
0,255 255,405 405,630 630,780 780,1025
couldn't you acquire the order

1345
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,490
0,260 260,470 470,665 665,800 800,1160
the objects in a preset

1346
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,915
0,260 550,855 855,1095 1095,1290 1290,1425
order? You could, but it

1347
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:48,250
0,135 135,255 255,515 565,960 960,1335

0,120 120,225 225,375 375,540 540,660
what the order is going

1354
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,620

0,300 300,620 790,1050 1050,1215 1215,1455
can't always, because we want

0,210 210,465 465,735 735,1095 1095,1275

1361

0,275 275,425 425,590 590,830 830,1070
And that was where in

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,545
0,305 305,610 750,1025 1025,1160 1160,1295
Great question. {I,like -} how

1374
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:23,450
0,120 120,225 225,345 345,555 555,905
you guys are thinking. Yep.|

1375
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,930
0,275 275,485 485,710 710,860 860,980
That is correct. {So,the -}

1376
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,385
0,210 210,560 760,1065 1065,1260 1260,1455
question was, can we say

1377
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:36,750
0,180 180,330 330,525 525,845 1105,1365
that as long as everyone

1378
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,250
0,225 225,480 480,690 690,1220 1240,1500
follows two phase locking, the

1379
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,080
0,240 240,570 570,810 810,1080 1080,1830
final schedule is conflict serializable

1380
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,960
0,290 700,1100
yes, and.|

1381
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,205
0,270 270,450 450,645 645,980 1000,1245
It's so, yes, that we

1382
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,405
0,105 105,240 240,780 780,1035 1035,1200
are not guaranteeing anything about

1383
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:45,790
0,420 420,795 795,945 945,1110 1110,1385
deadlocks. {Deadlocks,can -} still {happen.,We'll

1384
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,955
0,350 350,470 470,590 590,695 695,845
-} find a way to

1385
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:47,880
0,165 165,455
break it.|

1386
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,740
0,305 305,610 720,1120
Very good, yep.|

1387
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,540
0,365 365,730 750,1150
Exactly right. Yep.|

1388
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,840
0,290 290,470 470,760
Does this, sorry?|

1389
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,360
0,400 1140,1430 1430,1580 1580,1715 1715,1880
Ah, which one is not

1390
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,605
0,390 390,690 690,945 945,1095 1095,1245
shrinking this? This is just

1391
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:01,640
0,165 165,390 390,660 660,870 870,1035
a flat line saying all

1392
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,435
0,150 150,375 375,495 495,645 645,795
the locks are now being

1393
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,410
0,225 225,450 450,570 570,735 735,975
held for a little while.

1394
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,175
0,180 180,315 315,450 450,555 555,765
{Is,that -} what you mean?

1395
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:05,680
0,285 285,585 585,930 930,1200 1200,1505
Yeah, yeah, {yeah.,So,I - -}

1396
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,805
0,515 515,790 810,1210 1290,1610 1610,1835
scanned my file, I acquired

1397
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,125
0,180 180,330 330,785 835,1110 1110,1320
all {my,locks.,Now - -} I'm

1398
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,220
0,210 210,570 570,840 840,975 975,1095
just adding all of them

1399
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,835
0,195 195,375 375,450 450,525 525,615
up because I have an

1400
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:12,130
0,465 465,675 675,810 810,1020 1020,1295
aggregate stuff, {so,it's,flat. - -}

1401
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,130
0,290 290,455 455,635 635,815 815,980
Then I start to drop

1402
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,140
0,150 150,560
the locks.|

1403
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,335
0,305 305,545 545,695 695,860 860,1055
So it's just to show

1404
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:16,355
0,255 255,435 435,615 615,840 840,1020
that the lock point is

1405
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:17,165
0,135 135,270 270,450 450,630 630,810
when you reach the peak

1406
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,290
0,240 240,435 435,555 555,750 750,1125
after that, if you're plateauing

1407
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,115
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,660 660,825
out because you're holding the

1408
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:20,140
0,285 285,435 435,615 615,735 735,1025
locks while you're doing something,

1409
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,260
0,260 260,410 410,590 590,755 755,890
the lock point is when

1410
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,280
0,120 120,285 285,450 450,710 790,1020
you reach the peak. {So,it's

1411
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,350
0,135 135,195 195,345 345,650 670,1070
-} a very precise definition

1412
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,850
0,275 275,425 425,620 620,815 815,1090
of when that event happened.|

1413
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,040
0,400
Okay.|

1414
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,690
0,120 120,225 225,420 420,600 600,690
Is it possible to have

1415
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,060
0,120 120,315 315,540 540,830
a graph where like?|

1416
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,715
0,260 260,410 410,755 755,1100 1100,1445
1 then drops everything. {Yes,,absolutely

1417
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,680
0,365 1105,1440 1440,1650 1650,1800 1800,1965
-} {that.,That -} will still

1418
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
0,135 135,380
be fine.|

1419
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,320
0,400 630,935 935,1130 1130,1280 1280,1460
So as long as I'm

1420
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,965
0,135 135,270 270,360 360,495 495,645
going to a peak and

1421
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,860
0,165 165,405 405,720 720,965 1495,1895
then dropping, it's fine somewhere.

1422
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,995
0,260 260,440 440,560 560,725 725,875
{No,,it's -} not bad in

1423
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:44,000
0,165 165,300 300,420 420,690 690,1005
some way, in {fact.,Yeah, -}

1424
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,750
0,240 240,345 345,495 495,630 630,750
you'll see that we will

1425
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,560
0,135 135,270 270,390 390,585 585,810
need to do something like

1426
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,375
0,290 430,830 940,1410 1410,1605 1605,1815
that, a weaker version of

1427
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,520
0,180 180,360 360,635
that to make.|

1428
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,765
0,225 225,465 465,765 765,975 975,1245
A certain problem in this

1429
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,355
0,330 330,665 985,1245 1245,1440 1440,1590
go away. {Okay,,there's -} still

1430
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:53,320
0,210 210,465 465,815 1225,1625 1675,1965
one tiny problem in two

1431
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,280
0,195 195,525 525,660 660,795 795,960
phase locking, so wait for

1432
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,500
0,210 210,530
two slides.|

1433
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,480
0,320 320,640
Other questions?|

1434
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,370
0,245 245,350 350,470 470,620 620,770
Because if you get this

1435
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,330
0,420 420,660 660,765 765,855 855,960
intuition, then you have the

1436
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,460
0,260 400,800 1090,1490 1510,1845 1845,2130
foundation to understand 50 different

1437
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,495
0,255 255,555 555,690 690,870 870,1035
lock modes and all kinds

1438
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,830
0,135 135,315 315,615 615,995 1075,1335
of other crazy stuff. {But,if

1439
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,445
0,105 105,195 195,375 375,480 480,615
-} you don't get this

1440
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:07,230
0,455 715,1095 1095,1200 1200,1475 1495,1785
intuition, there's no hope of

1441
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,780
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,840 840,1550
getting to something more sophisticated.|

1442
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,285
0,305 305,515 515,820 1080,1355 1355,1535
All right, so two phase

1443
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:13,220
0,485 565,990 990,1265 1375,1710 1710,1935
violation peaks. {Bad,right? -} No

1444
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,265
0,470 760,1160 1780,2085 2085,2390 2680,3045
{valleys.,Ah, -} so now let's

1445
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:17,300
0,120 120,395
go back.|

1446
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,930
0,150 150,255 255,390 390,525 525,630
This is going to be

1447
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,070
0,180 180,630 630,870 870,1020 1020,1140
very trivial. {Looks,like -} all

1448
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,960
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,585 585,890
of you guys got {it.,You'll

1449
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,305
0,425 425,650 650,830 830,1070 1070,1325
-} acquired the lock that

1450
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,450
0,165 165,315 315,605 1075,1475 1825,2145
willll {get,granted. -} Now when

1451
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,890
0,195 195,375 375,615 615,950 1120,1440
you get that second request

1452
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,620
0,195 195,315 315,540 540,920 1330,1730
for the X lock, ah,

1453
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,150
0,290 290,485 485,710 710,950 950,1270
it will get pushed down

1454
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,080
0,400 450,800 800,1040 1040,1370 1370,1520
so that you won't be

1455
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,590
0,270 270,630 630,1010 1360,1760 2110,2510
{granted,that -} request. And, ah,

1456
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,510
0,400 420,820 930,1190 1190,1355 1355,1660
you, yeah, you will start

1457
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,500
0,305 305,610 1380,1655 1655,1805 1805,1940
to see some of that

1458
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,420
0,260
issues.|

1459
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,165
0,365 365,545 545,740 740,890 890,1265
What's happening in the dependence

1460
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:40,035
0,225 225,405 405,525 525,660 660,870
graph? That was the question

1461
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:41,520
0,195 195,330 330,570 570,935
that was asked, right?|

1462
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,320
0,335 335,620 620,935 935,1280 1280,1550
The first X lock is

1463
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,430
0,150 150,300 300,590 700,945 945,1110
for the transaction. {See,the -}

1464
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,600
0,375 375,585 585,750 750,945 945,1170

0,195 195,515 805,1170 1170,1410 1410,1680
{any,further. -} It's basically saying

1469
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:51,750
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,525 525,705
if I let you go

1470
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,370
0,320 880,1140 1140,1290 1290,1470 1470,1620
forward, I will form an

1471
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,240
0,270 270,405 405,555 555,720 720,870
arc from t one to

1472
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,575
0,165 165,945 945,1095 1095,1200 1200,1335
t 2. I'm going {to,kill

1473
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:56,775
0,165 165,485 565,885 885,990 990,1200
-} that. I'm not even

1474
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:57,710
0,225 225,375 375,510 510,660 660,935
going {to,let,that - -} happen.

1475
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,920
0,275 275,395 395,650 650,830 830,1010
If I don't allow that

1476
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,860
0,150 150,410 700,1005 1005,1310
to happen, there is.|

1477
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,050
0,270 270,560 580,825 825,930 930,1190
No cycle to be formed

1478
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,965
0,260 260,575 575,860 860,1415 1415,1835
because I'm allowed disallowing arcs

1479
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:05,060
0,135 135,395
from happening.|

1480
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,760
0,290 290,425 425,605 605,695 695,1280
And so it's a pessimistic

1481
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,935
0,290 700,1050 1050,1350 1350,1950 1950,2175
form, right? It's pessimistic because

1482
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,180
0,305 325,630 630,810 810,1050 1050,1245
maybe just one arc is

1483
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,455
0,350 520,795 795,975 975,1140 1140,1275
okay. {The,cycle -} has not

1484
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:13,745
0,240 240,605 715,990 990,1125 1125,1290
been {completed.,And -} so we'll

1485
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:14,915
0,150 150,315 315,405 405,635 865,1170
talk about the optimistic {stuff,later.

1486
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,010
0,305 385,645 645,840 840,960 960,1095
-} But that's kind of

1487
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,525
0,90 90,500 610,975 975,1335 1335,1515
the intuition and connecting back

1488
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:18,590
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,630 630,1065
to where all this dependence

1489
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,525
0,285 285,650 1330,1590 1590,1725 1725,1935
graph is, you know, when

1490
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:22,370
0,225 225,515 985,1350 1350,1635 1635,1845
it gets and why that

1491
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,810
0,210 210,530 550,855 855,1050 1050,1440
makes sense, and why locking

1492
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,145
0,255 255,540 540,765 765,1080 1080,1335
works is because it's breaking

1493
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,375
0,240 240,705 705,960 960,1110 1110,1230
these arcs as they are

1494
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,300
0,195 195,515
getting formed.|

1495
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,580
0,335 335,440 440,575 575,850
Let's say I have.|

1496
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,510
0,165 165,315 315,555 555,840 840,930
To these guys, let's say

1497
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,200
0,105 105,285 285,495 495,600 600,690
the working guy on the

1498
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,505
0,260 490,765 765,990 990,1170 1170,1305
right, right after the X,

1499
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:33,390
0,195 195,390 390,540 540,690 690,885
lock a, the next log

1500
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,280
0,290
b.|

1501
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,320
0,290 290,425 425,530 530,710 710,1030
Right. {So,it -} once be

1502
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,020
0,350
and.|

1503
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,250
0,275 275,470 470,680 680,875 875,1130
But X lock a won't

1504
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,120
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,570 570,870
be so the question is

1505
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,575
0,330 330,585 585,795 795,1100 1150,1455
after X log a t

1506
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:40,460
0,210 210,390 390,525 525,690 690,885

1507
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,375
0,240 240,465 465,630 630,780 780,915
b, but X log a

1508
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,290
0,210 210,315 315,555 555,765 765,915
won't be granted, so it's

1509
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,505
0,90 90,195 195,270 270,590 880,1215
going to be evading. {That's,the

1510
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,095
0,105 105,365 475,875 1165,1440 1440,1590

0,275 275,425 425,905 905,1025 1025,1190
We could, theoretically, if this

1513
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,140
0,210 210,405 405,645 645,975 975,1200
b step is independent, we

1514
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,265
0,120 120,225 225,470 550,885 885,1125
could be using. {Yeah,,yeah. {-},So

1515
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:51,000
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,615 615,735
-} hold on for the

1516
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,365
0,420 420,675 675,1020 1020,1230 1230,1365
deadlocked {stuff,,yes. -} But if

1517
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:53,250
0,135 135,285 285,510 510,720 720,885
you did that and if

1518
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,120
0,165 165,315 315,525 525,705 705,870
t one wanted to use

0,195 195,470 730,1020 1020,1215 1215,1520
b later, that could {be,a

1520
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,735
0,275 275,515 515,880 900,1220 1220,1505
-} difference. So your question

1521
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,640
0,360 360,755 1195,1595

0,300 300,600 600,945 945,1320 1320,1665
T two wanted a and

1523
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:03,320
0,365 955,1230 1230,1395 1395,1650 1650,2015
b, could it say that

1524
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,470
0,305 305,500 500,635 635,755 755,950

0,180 180,300 300,435 435,645 645,855

0,135 135,410 850,1155 1155,1305 1305,1425
It can, and there are

1529
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,115
0,495 495,930 930,1125 1125,1260 1260,1410
sophisticated protocols that'll do that.

1530
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:10,895
0,150 150,315 315,450 450,570 570,780
{And,many -} of these different

0,375 375,615 615,750 750,1025 1105,1380
locking modes will say, do

1532
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:13,235
0,165 165,405 405,645 645,795 795,960
you really want an X

1533
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:14,255
0,270 270,570 570,765 765,900 900,1020

0,105 105,255 255,435 435,585 585,750
you just want to check

00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:15,890
0,180 180,315 315,465 465,630 630,885
that you can get it

1536
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,835
0,285 285,495 495,675 675,825 825,945
and stuff like that? So

1537
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,350
0,165 165,300 300,605 625,930 930,1515
we'll get to more sophisticated

1538
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,505
0,480 480,660 660,870 870,1020 1020,1155

1539
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,870
0,195 195,465 465,750 750,1050 1050,1365
the advanced class, but we'll

1540
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,755
0,285 285,480 480,600 600,735 735,885
allude to some of those

1541
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:22,730
0,255 255,495 495,660 660,855 855,975

0,260 370,645 645,920 1090,1395 1395,1560
Yeah, one of it's probably

1544
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,665
0,225 225,435 435,630 630,885 885,1125
also an advanced profile, but

1545
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:27,505
0,225 225,450 450,585 585,705 705,840
like, could you do like

1546
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,780
0,275 355,645 645,900 900,1140 1140,1275
priorities if like one of

1547
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,455
0,120 120,255 255,420 420,555 555,675
them is going to be

0,275
like?|

1549
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,265
0,270 270,375 375,630 630,915 915,1065
It's going to lock in

1550
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,525
0,105 105,300 300,780 780,1035 1035,1260
and like i'mlocking either we're

1551
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:32,945
0,75 75,165 165,255 255,345 345,420

1552

0,90 90,335 385,765 765,1145 1255,1500
an hour, yeah. {And,we -}

1553
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,750
0,120 120,240 240,675 675,965 1045,1305
want to prioritize, {absolutely.,You -}

1554
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,515
0,135 135,255 255,405 405,600 600,765
can do all kinds of

1555
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:37,595
0,270 270,570 570,780 780,915 915,1080
that and we'll talk about

1556
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,825
0,585 585,735 735,1035 1035,1140 1140,1230
granularities of locking where you

1557
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:39,905
0,135 135,420 420,690 690,900 900,1080
might say, if I've got,

1558
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:40,925
0,330 330,600 600,705 705,855 855,1020
I'm scanning a file with

1559
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,205
0,135 135,395 715,1445 1735,2100 2100,2280
a billion rows, acquiring a

1560
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:44,440
0,195 195,510 510,630 630,870 870,1235
billion locks is very expensive.|

1561
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,475
0,345 345,585 585,900 900,1155 1155,1395
It's more expensive than reading

1562
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:47,660
0,180 180,425 655,915 915,1050 1050,1185

1563
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,635
0,195 195,465 465,660 660,810 810,975
something better? So hold on

1564
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,520
0,135 135,395
to that.|

1565

0,380 380,760 1050,1325 1325,1490 1490,1775
Okay, great. {All,right. {-},So -}

1566
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:54,670
0,395 1105,1425 1425,1620 1620,1770 1770,1995
basically all this is saying

1567
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,975
0,270 270,590 730,1005 1005,1155 1155,1305
is that this is why

1568
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,040
0,300 300,570 570,855 855,975 975,1065
locking works, because we are

1569
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,170
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,600 600,1130
trying to break these arcs.|

1570
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,655
0,260 260,425 425,800 800,1120 1320,1595
From the dependence graph that

1571
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,245
0,150 150,360 360,695 745,1095 1095,1590
we talked about, the dependency

1572
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,040
0,165 165,315 315,435 435,615 615,795
graph that we talked about

1573
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,590
0,120 120,225 225,405 405,740 1150,1550
in the last class, okay.|

1574
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,260
0,400
So.|

1575
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,625
0,290 290,485 485,1000 1200,1600 2070,2345
Two face locking works, but

1576
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,945
0,135 135,300 300,525 525,845 1015,1320
it has one problem. {That,problem

1577
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:12,630
0,240 240,450 450,660 660,1215 1215,1685
-} is called cascading aborts.|

1578
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,370
0,320 320,1060 1200,1600 2190,2480 2480,2770
Remember databases start a transaction

1579
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,380
0,275 275,470 470,680 680,970
with the begin statement.|

1580
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,700
0,195 195,500
And then?|

1581
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,295
0,400 510,785 785,965 965,1145 1145,1295
Transaction could end with a

1582
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,420
0,270 270,555 555,765 765,960 960,1125
commit, which means make all

1583
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,410
0,135 135,380 400,690 690,855 855,990
the changes and make it

1584
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,565
0,260 580,810 810,900 900,1020 1020,1155
permanent. {Or,it -} could end

1585
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:25,800
0,180 180,330 330,585 585,750 750,1235
within a bot saying, whoops,

1586
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,280
0,590 590,970
undo everything.|

1587
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,550
0,395 395,620 620,860 860,995 995,1130
It's the and you want

1588
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,315
0,135 135,240 240,390 390,585 585,765
to do this all or

1589
00:39:29,315 --> 00:39:32,520
0,275 595,995 1585,1875 1875,2165
nothing component with transactions.|

1590
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,170
0,290 290,545 545,860 860,1205 1205,1490
But the point is a

1591
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,960
0,290 370,675 675,980 1000,1395 1395,1790
b can also happen. {Transaction,could

1592
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,560
0,305 305,470 470,850
-} get aborted.|

1593
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,490
0,240 240,420 420,585 585,720 720,930
And now, in the presence

1594
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,095
0,225 225,360 360,890 1030,1350 1350,1605
of a bots, you start

1595
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:42,260
0,210 210,420 420,755 1435,1800 1800,2165
to have this situation where

1596
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,115
0,395 395,665 665,905 905,1150 1170,1475
even if I'm following two

1597
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,060
0,255 255,720 720,1295
phase locking protocol.|

1598
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,965
0,275 275,470 470,790 1320,1670 1670,1895
I have a hole that

1599
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,675
0,165 165,390 390,755 835,1235 1435,1710
I've dug myself into and

1600
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:50,500
0,135 135,390 390,510 510,660 660,825
I can't get out of

1601
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,985
0,270 270,630 630,735 735,1010 1120,1485
it. {What's,that -} hole? Let's

1602
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:53,250
0,450 450,600 600,735 735,930 930,1265
illustrate that with an example.|

1603
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,300
0,335 335,620 620,845 845,1010 1010,1300
So here is a schedule

1604
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,855
0,275 275,440 440,730 840,1130 1130,1325
in which transaction t one

1605
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,020
0,305
starts.|

1606
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,790
0,350 350,560 560,785 785,965 965,1570
It's following two phase protocol.

1607
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,000
0,290 290,425 425,545 545,785 785,1040
{T,two -} is also doing

1608
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,100
0,135 135,380
the same.|

1609
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,870
0,230 250,630 630,900 900,1220 1480,1770
And acquires its lock, then

1610
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,145
0,465 465,660 660,885 885,1020 1020,1275
unlocks it because it doesn't

1611
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:08,450
0,275 685,1085 1675,2070 2070,2465 2905,3305
need ah, any of a

1612
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,335
0,400 600,920 920,1160 1160,1385 1385,1805
anymore. {Right,,so -} it reaches

1613
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:11,940
0,195 195,450 450,785 1135,1425 1425,1605
its lock point and now

1614
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,380
0,225 225,705 705,1020 1020,1245 1245,1440
after unlock all two phase

1615
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,580
0,360 360,570 570,765 765,1080 1080,1200
locking says you can't do

1616
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,880
0,165 165,345 345,830
any more locks.|

1617
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,740
0,395 395,820 870,1250 1250,1535 1535,1700
But it still continues to

1618
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,700
0,120 120,285 285,480 480,735 735,960
do work on b because

1619
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,240
0,120 120,360 360,705 705,950
it hasn't unlocked b.|

1620
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,625
0,335 335,670 780,1100 1100,1280 1280,1445
T two gets the lock

1621
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,555
0,180 180,405 405,615 615,735 735,930
for a because that was

1622
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,560
0,335
released.|

1623
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,750
0,335 335,530 530,650 650,785 785,1060
Starts to do its work.|

1624
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,785
0,305 305,560 560,845 845,1085 1085,1355
But later on, t one

1625
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,920
0,875 925,1245 1245,1515 1515,1800 1800,2135
proceeds and says, oh no,

1626
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,375
0,575 575,820 1260,1550 1550,1730 1730,1865
something's wrong, I need to

1627
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,260
0,335
abort.|

1628
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,820
0,400 1080,1340 1340,1445 1445,1595 1595,1880
Now we are all following

1629
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,380
0,255 255,465 465,1010
two phase locking.|

1630
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,495
0,400 930,1265 1265,1580 1580,1895 1895,2105
But t two has read

1631
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:40,920
0,135 135,375 375,755 985,1260 1260,1425
a value, a that has

1632
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,090
0,135 135,225 225,650 670,915 915,1170
to be undone, so it's

1633
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,080
0,290
red.|

1634
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,515
0,275 275,515 515,880 930,1280 1280,1355
A dirty value. {It's,a -}

1635
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:45,680
0,195 195,545
dirty read.|

1636
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,520
0,400
No.|

1637
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,050
0,225 225,525 525,945 945,1290 1290,1530
We can't unwind ourselves from

1638
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,175
0,290 400,735 735,930 930,1035 1035,1125
this. {Even,though -} we are

1639
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:51,270
0,210 210,450 450,645 645,1005 1005,1095
following two phase {locking.,We -}

1640
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,260
0,75 75,195 195,470 550,840 840,990
are in trouble when we

1641
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,370
0,165 165,360 360,705 705,915 915,1110
reach the abort call comes

1642
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,150
0,150 150,255 255,495 495,720 720,780
to {the,database. -} What are

1643
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,110
0,75 75,180 180,285 285,530 610,960
you going to do if

1644
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,745
0,240 240,660 660,870 870,1190 1360,1635
now undo t two? What

1645
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,825
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,720 720,1080
if t two was already

1646
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:59,865
0,365 595,995 1345,1680 1680,1890 1890,2040
committed and had already paid

1647
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:00,930
0,150 150,300 300,660 660,870 870,1065
out that 25 dollars? You

1648
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,140
0,180 180,465 465,740
can't undo that.|

1649
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,075
0,400 750,1025 1025,1340 1340,1490 1490,1685
So we can't let t

1650
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,180
0,180 180,455
two go.|

1651
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,235
0,290 290,455 455,730 1170,1520 1520,1745
If it is has got

1652
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:09,620
0,180 180,905 1255,1635 1635,1950 2190,2385
a dependency on t 1

1653
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,090
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,920 1120,1470
t one not committed, so

1654
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,020
0,240 240,405 405,525 525,705 705,930
how can we make two

1655
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,980
0,210 210,630 630,1310
face locking safer?|

1656
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,210
0,255 255,570 570,810 810,1005 1005,1230
To this type of problem,

1657
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,815
0,270 270,480 480,735 735,945 945,1605
it's already safe for serializable

1658
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:18,240
0,275 535,935
purposes, okay?|

1659
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,175
0,225 225,500 670,1035 1035,1400 1570,1935
But now it it still

1660
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:21,135
0,315 315,555 555,720 720,840 840,960
will require us to deal

1661
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:22,430
0,150 150,300 300,735 735,990 990,1295
with this cascading about problems

1662
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,200
0,275 275,550 600,860 860,1240
because transactions can abort.|

1663
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,690
0,400 480,770 770,935 935,1085 1085,1360
Everyone, does that make sense?|

1664
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,690
0,275 275,550 750,1025 1025,1190 1190,1340
Okay, so the way to

1665
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,350
0,150 150,315 315,590 700,1100 2260,2660
make it safe is to

1666
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,950
0,335 335,620 620,845 845,1040 1040,1250
do something a little bit

1667
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,360
0,290 610,900 900,1050 1050,1200 1200,1410
more with the two phase

1668
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,640
0,530 760,1080 1080,1395 1395,1695 1695,2280
locking, right? So this permissible

1669
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,230
0,290 940,1200 1200,1350 1350,1485 1485,1590
schedule, we want to make

1670
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,850
0,240 240,1140 1140,1335 1335,1470 1470,1620
it unadmittable in a new

1671
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:43,015
0,560 850,1250 1780,2130 2130,2750 2830,3165
protocol and the protocol is

1672
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:44,935
0,335 715,1115 1195,1500 1500,1695 1695,1920
called strong, strict two phase

1673
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,600
0,540 540,795 795,1140 1140,1380 1380,1665
locking. {The,textbook -} also calls

1674
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,360
0,315 315,855 855,1035 1035,1230 1230,1760
it rigorous two phase locking.|

1675
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,780
0,260 260,365 365,575 575,830 830,1010
And if you understand this

1676
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,905
0,210 210,465 465,765 765,990 990,1125
lock point business that we

1677
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,020
0,195 195,515
talked about.|

1678
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,220
0,195 195,500 670,930 930,1065 1065,1200
Right. {So,if -} you go

1679
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,165
0,150 150,420 420,675 675,795 795,945
back here, can you think

1680
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:54,975
0,195 195,375 375,525 525,660 660,810
about what you would do

1681
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:56,805
0,150 150,330 330,635 1015,1415 1495,1830
to this graph to make

1682
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,740
0,270 270,600 600,995 1375,1710 1710,1935
this problem better? So this

1683
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,910
0,150 150,330 330,525 525,960 960,1170
is the correct protocol, right,

1684
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,810
0,150 150,315 315,405 405,645 645,900
that we've been following so

1685
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,980
0,210 210,405 405,780 780,915 915,1170
far, but casting a bots

1686
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,980
0,260
happens.|

1687
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,970
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,665 665,890
Can you think of something

1688
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,690
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,555 555,720
to do to the shape

1689
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,080
0,195 195,375 375,680
of this graph?|

1690
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,760
0,395 395,725 725,1235 1235,1750
To stop cascading bots.|

1691
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,600
0,275 275,410 410,515 515,650 650,830
What was the root cause

1692
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,080
0,150 150,510 510,830 1030,1430
of cascading? Yep, yep.|

1693
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,030
0,400 510,830 830,1055 1055,1250 1250,1540
Correct release all at once

1694
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,330
0,290 290,455 455,575 575,740 740,950
and when do you release

1695
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,140
0,290
it?|

1696
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,145
0,400 870,1160 1160,1325 1325,1460 1460,1595
Exactly. {So,what -} if we

1697
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:22,420
0,275 325,630 630,855 855,1035 1035,1275
said you climb the mountain,

1698
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,350
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,810 810,930
it's a plateau and then

1699
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,560
0,180 180,285 285,560
it's a cliff.|

1700
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,175
0,305 305,560 560,785 785,995 995,1505
Which means you never unlock

1701
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,590
0,335 535,810 810,960 960,1125 1125,1415
early. {No,one -} can see

1702
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,285
0,320 320,640 810,1210 1740,2030 2030,2315
that a transaction, the a

1703
00:42:30,285 --> 00:42:32,840
0,395 865,1170 1170,1410 1410,2015 2155,2555
object that was grabbed was

1704
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,485
0,400 810,1085 1085,1205 1205,1295 1295,1385
basically, you know, if you

1705
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,235
0,135 135,300 300,450 450,585 585,750
had come up with that

1706
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:36,945
0,305 385,785 925,1500 1500,1620 1620,1710
in 19 seventies you would

1707
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,360
0,120 120,255 255,420 420,725 1015,1415
have won an award, so.|

1708
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,780
0,260 260,380 380,515 515,695 695,890
But it was very hard

1709
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,545
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,630 630,765
at that time to just

1710
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:43,310
0,135 135,255 255,435 435,630 630,765
get your head around all

1711
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,780
0,135 135,315 315,620 880,1230 1230,1470
of this stuff. {It,becomes -}

1712

0,285 285,570 570,860 880,1245 1245,1380
easy because now I've shown

1713
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,045

0,300 300,465 465,660 660,975 975,1230
always the case where when

1715
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,400
0,255 255,600 600,780 780,885 885,1125
someone explains to you something

0,315 315,510 510,630 630,750 750,855
simply, you say, oh, it

1717
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:51,620
0,150 150,635 685,1035 1035,1245 1245,1365
{is,trivial. -} But if you

1718

0,225 225,375 375,600 600,810 810,1005
didn't have that, it just

1719
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,585
0,165 165,285 285,480 480,720 720,960
took a long time {to,conceptualize

1720
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:55,610
0,600 600,905 955,1350 1350,1890 1890,2025
-} that. And abstraction in

1721
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,675
0,135 135,330 330,555 555,825 825,1065
that right way is the

0,275
art.|

1723
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,000
0,225 225,435 435,630 630,810 810,1520
Of coming up with breakthroughs.|

0,240 240,465 465,630 630,795 795,1005
So this is what we

1725
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:01,580
0,335
do.|

1726
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,170
0,275 275,515 515,725 725,920 920,1130
The problem we ran into

1727
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,075
0,240 240,765 765,975 975,1280 1540,1905
is unlock of a allowed

1728
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:06,230
0,210 210,375 375,695 775,1020 1020,1155
the other transaction to come

1729
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,295
0,195 195,345 345,465 465,740 790,1065
in who was following two

1730
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:08,690
0,210 210,750 750,1020 1020,1230 1230,1395
phase locking and start to

1731
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,250
0,165 165,420 420,770 1120,1410 1410,1560
see bad stuff. {But,now -}

1732
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,320
0,135 135,285 285,450 450,705 705,1070
if you do this strict,

1733
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,875
0,365 365,635 635,815 815,1010 1010,1535
strong, strict two phase locking

1734
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,940
0,270 270,465 465,690 690,855 855,1065
you say climb the mountain,

1735
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,560
0,315 315,560 640,1185 1185,1440 1440,1620
it's a plateau all the

1736
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,625
0,165 165,470 490,780 780,930 930,1065
way through and then in

1737
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,735
0,120 120,365 475,780 780,975 975,1110
the end drop all the

0,275 275,410 410,515 515,680 680,1070
And just a little tidbit,

1740
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,940
0,270 270,510 510,735 735,915 915,1110
obviously, you won't drop all

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,240
0,150 150,435 435,1520 1630,2055 2055,2300
the locks simultaneously, it'll be

0,165 165,315 315,465 465,630 630,765

0,180 180,330 330,480 480,675 675,870
then you can start to

0,120 120,380 460,735 735,915 915,1110

0,150 150,425
that happen.|

1767

0,275 275,485 485,800 800,1025 1025,1385
But now, hopefully, this intuition

1768
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,615
0,225 225,435 435,675 675,995 1195,1560
makes sense this way. {Whoever,reaches

0,345 345,645 645,950 1300,1935 1935,2145
ahead in the dependency graph

0,210 210,360 360,635 835,1235 1525,1830
that you draw, and no

0,180 180,345 345,635 985,1385 1405,1695
one can see changes made

0,135 135,240 240,500 550,810 810,1050
by a transaction till it's

0,300 300,705 705,840 840,1130 1300,1590
dirty reads will get ah

1776
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,545
0,285 285,680 760,1050 1050,1185 1185,1365
passed across, and the later

0,330 330,645 645,840 840,1005 1005,1125
abort doesn't cause you to

0,435 435,600 600,860 1300,1605 1605,1815
unwind a transaction whose state

0,350 350,545 545,650 650,910 930,1250
Yeah, so if I understand

1784
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,950
0,210 210,500 520,885 885,1140 1140,1350
your question correctly, is that

1785
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,315
0,210 210,500 610,900 900,1215 1215,1365
the transaction that reaches the

1786
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,020
0,210 210,495 495,845

0,135 135,270 270,405 405,630 630,885
Can you make it commit

1788
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:43,040
0,305
first?|

1789
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,160
0,290
Uh.|

1790
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,140
0,320 490,890 1060,1460 1480,1785 1785,1980
Why so? It depends upon

1791
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,995
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,705 705,855
why is the plateau. {The,plateau

1792
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:48,450
0,300 300,480 480,735 735,1140 1140,1455
-} is because I've gotten

1793
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,310
0,300 300,525 525,830 1300,1635 1635,1860

0,135 135,285 285,465 465,615 615,750
the data I {need.,Now,I'm -

0,180 180,440 520,780 780,960 960,1230
-} processing the data, like

1796
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,910
0,315 315,420 420,960 960,1275 1275,1620
computing an aggregate and a

0,345 345,450 450,660 660,885 885,1125
computing, a join or something

1798
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,015
0,270 270,575 775,1175 1345,1680 1680,1980
{like,that. -} So that time

1799
00:44:57,015 --> 00:44:57,945
0,270 270,465 465,630 630,795 795,930

0,90 90,300 300,525 525,690 690,840

0,150 150,315 315,420 420,555 555,690
work that I want to

1802

0,120 120,255 255,360 360,665

0,90 90,180 180,420 420,645 645,885
So I can just drop

1804
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:02,350
0,225 225,435 435,585 585,675 675,765
it right there. {I,have -}

1805

0,120 120,270 270,420 420,555 555,690
to wait till all of

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,320
0,135 135,285 285,450 450,740
that work is done.|

1807
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,695
0,275 275,410 410,545 545,710 710,875
Does that make sense? Or

1808
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:06,655
0,165 165,300 300,585 585,810 810,960
maybe I didn't understand your

1809
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:07,660
0,275
question.|

1810
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,720
0,365 365,650 650,860 860,1115 1115,1480
I thought your question is,

1811
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,735
0,290 290,455 455,575 575,710 710,875
why do we have a

1812
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:15,625
0,515 1045,1335 1335,1590 1590,1695 1695,1890
plateau? Why can't we just

1813
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:16,620
0,225 225,390 390,525 525,690 690,995
drop at the lock point,

1814
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,660
0,400
correct?|

1815
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,835
0,400 510,910 1140,1430 1430,1895 1895,2135
Yeah, because the plateau is

1816
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:20,765
0,195 195,345 345,525 525,735 735,930
where the work on that

1817
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:22,925
0,305 595,900 900,1110 1110,1415 1825,2160

0,195 195,300 300,405 405,585 585,810
that we have read is

1819
00:45:23,735 --> 00:45:25,240
0,300 300,615 615,935
probably getting done.|

1820
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,290
0,350 350,605 605,770 770,890 890,1010
So could you have a

1821
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,865
0,260 670,945 945,1095 1095,1425 1425,1575
transaction? Could the plateau be

1822
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:30,130
0,210 210,420 420,585 585,870 870,1265
zero? In some cases, yes.|

1823
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,655
0,195 195,360 360,495 495,630 630,795
If all the work it

1824
00:45:31,655 --> 00:45:32,735
0,255 255,540 540,765 765,945 945,1080
needed, for example, if this

1825
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:34,440
0,150 150,390 390,660 660,995
were an update query.|

1826
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,655
0,150 150,300 300,510 510,860 880,1215
And the last thing that

1827
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:36,465
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,645 645,810
when it reached the lock

1828
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:37,380
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,675 675,915
point was the last record

1829
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,745
0,195 195,390 390,675 675,1020 1020,1365
it needed to update it

1830
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:39,900
0,330 330,585 585,840 840,975 975,1155
updates and drops it. {The,plateau

-} will be very small.|

1832
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,940
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,820
Does that make sense?|

1833
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,915
0,350 350,515 515,850 930,1235 1235,1415
It's also possible that, you

1834
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:48,950
0,240 240,495 495,675 675,840 840,1035
know, I grab a lock

1835

0,320 430,720 720,855 855,1050 1050,1380
here and then I'm clattering

1836
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,170
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,645 645,840
for a long time before

1837
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,620
0,135 135,345 345,525 525,920
I grab the locks.|

1838
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,875
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,875 875,1115
You know, I read a

1839
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,060
0,275 505,765 765,945 945,1050 1050,1185
table, then I'm going to

1840
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,870
0,150 150,330 330,510 510,675 675,810
do some work with it.

1841
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,560
0,120 120,300 300,465 465,555 555,690
{Then,I,decide - -} I want

0,120 120,210 210,420 420,770 1000,1380
to do something else based

1843

0,255 255,390 390,705 705,855 855,990
upon the contents of what

0,225 225,450 450,675 675,1065 1065,1245
you know, the plateaus {and,peaks.

1846
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:02,440
0,300 300,555 555,720 720,840 840,975
-} All we have is

0,135 135,270 270,465 465,705 705,885
that the growing phase is

monotonically increasing plateau and then

1850
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:08,620
0,305 720,915 915,1125 1125,1590 1590,1845
{drop,2 -} phase locking. It's

0,75 75,795 795,1100
a monotonically increasing.|

1852

0,260 260,380 380,500 500,800 800,935

both sides.|

0,365 365,590 590,710 710,890 890,1175
Yeah, so the question is,

1899
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,010
0,225 225,450 450,675 675,825 825,975

00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,385
0,255 255,885 885,1160 1570,1935 1935,2055

1902
00:47:39,385 --> 00:47:40,760
0,165 165,375 375,845

1903
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,210
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,770 770,1040
They will hold the locks

1904
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,320
0,165 165,525 525,810 810,930 930,1110
but weaker locks so other

1905
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,595
0,300 300,450 450,615 615,890 1000,1275
locks can get in, so

1906
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,020
0,180 180,345 345,605 925,1245 1245,1425
wait for that and we

1907
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:46,815
0,135 135,285 285,465 465,615 615,795

0,305 305,610 810,1210 1590,1985 1985,2120

0,290 550,840 840,1130 1180,1530 1530,1860

0,195 195,420 420,720 720,1230 1230,1455
So he keeps transferring money

1930
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:21,500
0,365 535,870 870,1110 1110,1260 1260,1365

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,100
0,225 225,420 420,555 555,1010 1060,1380

0,120 120,270 270,510 510,765 765,1055
let the cycle get far.|

1961
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,010
0,290 290,575 575,920 920,1270 1410,1810
All right, and strict, strong,

1962
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,490
0,290 290,470 470,680 680,1205 1205,1460
strict, two phase locking in

1963
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,845
0,210 210,530 610,915 915,1220 1990,2355
this case would basically require

1964
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:13,120
0,255 255,450 450,645 645,930 930,1275
that a and b both

1965
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,820
0,240 240,530 940,1260 1260,1440 1440,1700
be held till the end.|

1966
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,360
0,400 870,1175 1175,1480 1530,1930
And you basically are.|

1967
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,405
0,400 480,815 815,1025 1025,1160 1160,1355
Effectively running t one after

1968
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:21,440
0,240 240,480 480,705 705,945 945,1035
t two, right? There's no

1969
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,080
0,465 465,740 880,1170 1170,1350 1350,1640
parallelism there in this case.|

1970
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,400
0,290 290,580
All right.|

1971
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,890
0,350 550,870 870,1080 1080,1230 1230,1490
So going back to this.|

1972
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,195
0,575 575,1090 1290,1690 1830,2105 2105,2315
Serial schedules, right? A bigger

1973
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:33,530
0,390 390,525 525,785 1015,1245 1245,1335

0,150 150,375 375,570 570,675 675,810
doing that because you want

1975
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,540
0,165 165,345 345,570 570,890 910,1200
to allow more stuff, use

1976
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,530
0,150 150,410 430,690 690,810 810,990
the database, make it more

1977

1978
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,775

1980
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:43,295

1982
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:46,320
0,330 330,665
across that.|

1983
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,090
0,180 180,405 405,660 660,980 1000,1770
There are some complex serializable

1984
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,360
0,290
schedule.|

1985
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,115
0,380 460,750 750,1020 1020,1395 1395,1755
That it will remove from

1986
00:49:51,115 --> 00:49:53,140
0,365 1015,1320 1320,1500 1500,1665 1665,2025
consideration, but make it safer

1987
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,830
0,150 150,285 285,405 405,585 585,690
so that you don't have

1988
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:54,940
0,120 120,540 540,780 780,960 960,1110
the cascading board case. {So,we've

1989
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,545
0,345 345,810 810,1100 1120,1440 1440,1605

00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:57,640
0,150 150,345 345,635
little bit more.|

1991
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,560
0,400 450,710 710,1040 1040,1330 1530,1820
Obviously, a serial schedule is

1992
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,280
0,165 165,315 315,435 435,540 540,720
not going to have that

0,180 180,300 300,435 435,630 630,885
because you know the outcome

1994
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,305

0,290 290,470 470,680 680,860 860,1040
when we start to do

1997
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,265
0,210 210,375 375,570 570,975 975,1185
strict two phase locking, we're

1998
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:08,420
0,245 595,900 900,975 975,1065 1065,1155
saying we're going to have

00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,115
0,105 105,270 270,480 480,1190 1420,1695
a little less parallelism, but

2000
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:11,045
0,180 180,315 315,570 570,810 810,930
we're doing that because we

00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,140
0,135 135,315 315,495 495,660 660,1095

2003
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,360

Right.|

2004
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,100
0,350 350,560 560,820
Questions on this?|

2005
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,680

0,470 910,1200 1200,1380 1380,1605 1605,1785
Let's just make sure we

2007
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:27,235
0,245 445,780 780,1115 1285,1560 1560,1770

0,300 300,600 600,915 915,1200 1200,1365
about the strong, strict two

2009

0,195 195,740 940,1245 1245,1440 1440,1605
phase locking, as many of

2010

0,105 105,270 270,495 495,785 1795,2100
you have already asked, what

2011
00:50:32,305 --> 00:50:34,950
0,305 535,935 1045,1445 1465,1865 2245,2645
about that situations where transactions

2012
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,160
0,275 410,545 545,695 695,905 905,1100

0,270 270,590 790,1110 1110,1425 1425,1820
That's exactly the example here.

2016
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,365

2027

0,350 350,605 605,830 830,1040 1040,1220
because t two t one

0,180 180,405 405,690 690,900 900,1050
still get ourselves into this

2036
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,065
0,275 275,395 395,515 515,635 635,725
So we need to get

2037

0,120 120,285 285,575 625,915 915,1080
out of this and for

0,275 355,615 615,735 735,870 870,1535
that there are these mechanisms

0,400 420,800 800,1340 1340,1460 1460,1670
to find deadlocks. {So,that -}

2040
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,430
0,270 270,495 495,690 690,840 840,1310

0,335 335,500 500,575 575,710 710,1000

0,270 270,420 420,645 645,915 915,1095

2059
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,475
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,540 540,1080
of it as being pessimistic.

2060
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:45,090
0,165 165,255 255,360 360,450 450,615
{It's,going -} to say, I'm

2061
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,290
0,105 105,240 240,405 405,710 910,1200
going to stop you as

2062
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,760
0,240 240,465 465,740
early as possible.|

2063
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,645
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,680 680,815
Okay, but now this is

2064
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:50,190
0,150 150,690 690,965 1105,1395 1395,1545
for deadlocks, right? Not for

2065
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,920
0,165 165,540 540,810 810,1160
the dependence graph stuff.|

2066
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,945
0,380 380,950 950,1100 1100,1390 1620,2015
Similar concepts, but different applications,

2067
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,130
0,390 390,765 765,1005 1005,1095 1095,1185
different problem that we are

2068
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,280
0,150 150,300 300,560
trying to solve.|

2069
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,255
0,400 450,770 770,1025 1025,1265 1265,1475
So we create these things

2070
00:51:58,255 --> 00:52:00,000
0,225 225,435 435,705 705,1050 1050,1745
called the weight for graphs.|

2071
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,395
0,320 320,560 560,815 815,1250 1250,1625
They look like dependence graphs,

2072
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:04,560
0,275 295,695 895,1260 1260,1500 1500,2165
similar ideas, but for deadlocks,

2073
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,740
0,400
okay.|

2074
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,420
0,275 275,455 455,760 1080,1430 1430,1640
All right, so imagine I

2075
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,010
0,260 550,810 810,990 990,1200 1200,1590
have a wait for graphs

2076
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,135
0,290 310,615 615,810 810,945 945,1125
that are going to be

2077
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,250
0,360 360,510 510,645 645,810 810,1115

2078
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,170

0,275 275,425 425,575 575,710 710,845
Not in terms of the

2080
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:17,260
0,195 195,480 480,845 865,1125 1125,1245
read write stuff, which is

2081
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,430
0,135 135,300 300,690 690,945 945,1170
what the dependence graph stuff,

2082
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,720
0,150 150,345 345,590 820,1185 1185,1290
so they're different. {Don't,get -}

0,260 260,395 395,640 690,1090 1140,1415
But they also related, if

2085
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:24,920
0,135 135,300 300,465 465,570 570,645
you think about it a

0,135 135,440 490,780 780,915 915,1035
little bit, and they can

2087
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:27,395
0,135 135,270 270,510 510,875 1135,1440

0,165 165,645 645,810 810,1110 1110,1410
the concepts are different. {This,will

0,135 135,270 270,525 525,840 840,1020
And from that information, you

2096
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,710
0,135 135,345 345,570 570,810 810,1050

0,290 290,470 470,650 650,800 800,980
and then tries to lock

0,165 165,300 300,495 495,720 720,1035
it's just showing an example

across three transactions.|

2110
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,020
0,320

0,270 270,420 420,555 555,830 850,1140
As you can see, this

0,150 150,285 285,480 480,765 765,1130

0,270 270,525 525,815 895,1170 1170,1320
fashion in this to say,

2116
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,730
0,275 655,915 915,1065 1065,1305 1305,1545
oh, who is waiting for

2117
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,915
0,270 270,555 555,825 825,990 990,1185
what, and that's what becomes

2118
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:13,160
0,150 150,450 450,695
an arc here.|

2119

0,305 305,665 665,860 860,1040 1040,1235
The dependence graph was this

00:53:15,245 --> 00:53:16,910
0,195 195,405 405,720 720,1115 1345,1665
way right in time here.

2121
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,020

0,270 270,560
in time.|

2123
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,380
0,400 840,1240
So, uh.|

2124
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,655
0,365 365,650 650,845 845,1040 1040,1235
Say Steven is waiting for

00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:25,180
0,225 225,450 450,615 615,905
something from t two.|

2126
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,550
0,320 320,500 500,635 635,830 830,1010
T two is waiting for

0,225 225,590 1090,1425 1425,1760
something from t three.|

2128
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,475
0,400 600,875 875,1355 1355,1960 2280,2555
And the deadlock completes when

2129
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,630
0,165 165,455 475,765 765,960 960,1155
that last request comes in,

0,165 165,330 330,540 540,765 765,1035
at this point, no progress

0,260 1270,1665 1665,1950 1950,2115 2115,2280
Cool observation has been that

0,210 210,600 600,780 780,915 915,1020

0,195 195,495 495,860 1120,1380 1380,1485
of length too. {So,a -}

0,375 375,765 765,990 990,1155 1155,1275
deadlock detection itself is a

0,195 195,545 865,1125 1125,1260 1260,1425
very expensive, so many times

2150
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,905
0,240 240,495 495,800 1030,1290 1290,1455

0,180 180,390 390,555 555,630 630,780

00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:04,765
0,165 165,330 330,635 655,930 930,1080
of how frequently should I

0,335 335,650 650,800 800,1010 1010,1205
so computing this graph can

2160
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:15,740
0,150 150,425 445,845

0,165 165,270 270,360 360,570 570,1125
But they are cheaper algorithms

2162
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:19,010
0,150 150,330 330,635 1105,1775 1825,2145
to, say, find graphs, find

0,345 345,495 495,705 705,990 990,1215
cycles of length too, which

0,165 165,300 300,405 405,525 525,780
can be done a lot

2165
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:23,420
0,395 955,1355 1405,1770 1770,2205 2205,2415

2170
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,380
0,275 275,425 425,700 780,1055 1055,1330

0,225 225,555 555,1005 1005,1185 1185,1410
just find cycles of length

2173
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:36,985
0,335 595,900 900,1125 1125,1445 1465,1740
too, but less frequently for

00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,360
0,105 105,285 285,815
the bigger cycles.|

0,400 570,920 920,1040 1040,1190 1190,1630
Okay, that's just a tidbit

2176
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,265
0,290 290,455 455,575 575,695 695,965
in case you get super

0,165 165,375 375,680 910,1290 1290,1575
main point is finding this

2180
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:50,465
0,285 285,540 540,780 780,930 930,1110

0,195 195,435 435,615 615,1005 1005,1305
are lots of entries is

2184
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:56,395
0,365 625,870 870,960 960,1155 1155,1290
expensive, so you can't just

2185
00:54:56,395 --> 00:54:57,330
0,195 195,360 360,525 525,675 675,935
run this all the time,

00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,135
0,335 335,410 410,500 500,605 605,725
you're going to have to

0,105 105,240 240,995
run it periodically.|

0,275 275,545 545,950 950,1085 1085,1250
Okay, so that's the trade

2189
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,410

the deadlock quickly, but you're

2194

0,150 150,300 300,405 405,555 555,945

0,180 180,480 480,840 840,945 945,1170
you check, let's say, every

0,135 135,270 270,545 595,975 975,1355
can I maintain this lock

0,165 165,315 315,510 510,735 735,1040
that will add more cost.|

you start to say I

0,180 180,375 375,630 630,855 855,1020

0,195 195,495 495,840 840,1430 1630,1950
to have these locks not

0,120 120,240 240,765 765,1050 1050,1185
what the hierarchical locking will

2226
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:01,325
0,120 120,255 255,450 450,525 525,615

0,275 275,425 425,530 530,605 605,740

0,105 105,380 430,795 795,1500 1500,1680

0,305 305,830 830,1145 1145,1510 2040,2360
like snowflake data breaks all

0,400 540,940 1080,1640 1640,2200 2310,2690

2254
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,885
0,285 285,450 450,615 615,765 765,885

0,180 180,285 285,390 390,510 510,705
Now you have to choose

2258
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:50,855
0,240 240,480 480,585 585,845 1105,1410
which node to kill which

2259
00:56:50,855 --> 00:56:52,655
0,305 415,660 660,750 750,995 1435,1800
transaction to a board. {And,this

2260
00:56:52,655 --> 00:56:53,855
0,240 240,435 435,690 690,945 945,1200
-} is remember last time

2261
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:55,700
0,195 195,405 405,755 835,1235 1555,1845
we talked about how a

2262
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,855
0,290 340,615 615,765 765,915 915,1155
transaction may start and sometimes

2263
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:58,115
0,225 225,480 480,735 735,1065 1065,1260
a database may abort the

2264
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,255
0,275 415,720 720,900 900,1035 1035,1140
transaction for {you.,So -} you

2265
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:01,055
0,90 90,315 315,630 630,1325 1495,1800
as an applications programmer write

2266
00:57:01,055 --> 00:57:03,800
0,180 180,455 1465,1865 2335,2595 2595,2745
your code and you have

2267
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,805
0,135 135,240 240,435 435,750 750,1005
to be ready for what

2268
00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:05,800
0,195 195,375 375,495 495,630 630,995
happens if it {gets,aborted. -}

2269
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,610
0,320 320,605 605,860 860,1145 1145,1490
So often in good applications

2270
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,570
0,270 270,360 360,495 495,630 630,960
you'll say if a bot

2271
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,910
0,435 435,660 660,900 900,1080 1080,1340

2272
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,805
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,665 665,845
before you give up and

2273
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,280
0,165 165,405 405,720 720,1055

0,305 305,530 530,850 960,1220 1220,1355
Why would someone, why would

2275
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,465
0,120 120,365 445,735 735,1020 1020,1500
the database support that deadlock

2277
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,170
0,305 305,470 470,590 590,740 740,1030
right? You were doing something,

2278
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,440
0,260 260,380 380,605 605,920 920,1160
some of the application code

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,925
0,180 180,360 360,650 1000,1320 1320,1485

0,240 240,540 540,705 705,885 885,1095
that's theort is not because

0,180 180,720 720,960 960,1305 1305,1695
the programmer had an explicit

2286
00:57:30,165 --> 00:57:31,350
0,255 255,570 570,900 900,1065 1065,1185
abort call is because the

0,260 310,585 585,705 705,945 945,1140

2288
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,880
0,210 210,405 405,890
so a deadlock.|

0,320 1210,1500 1500,1665 1665,1815 1815,2040
And how would you choose

00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,865
0,240 240,375 375,570 570,810 810,945
what the victim is? There

00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:37,885
0,90 90,330 330,675 675,885 885,1020
are multiple ways you could

2293
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,465
0,360 360,1070 1960,2265 2265,2430 2430,2565
Lowest timestamp or you could

2294
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:42,935
0,275 295,555 555,735 735,1170 1170,1470

0,335 415,675 675,795 795,945 945,1095

0,210 210,435 435,585 585,860 1180,1440
least amount of work. {You,might

0,300 300,795 795,1095 1095,1400 1780,2055

0,180 180,330 330,450 450,675 675,1025
the begin and end statements,

2301
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,980
0,320 320,515 515,665 665,875 875,1040

0,120 120,255 255,375 375,525 525,750
other one is just fired

0,350 400,645 645,780 780,900 900,1185
two, so I'm going to

2304
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:55,480
0,395 565,885 885,1110 1110,1290 1290,1565
go, ah, kill the transaction,

2305
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,720
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,845 845,1070
which has done less amount

2306
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,620
0,150 150,410
of work.|

2307
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,495
0,290 290,440 440,605 605,785 785,1055
By the number of items

2308
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:00,335
0,255 255,390 390,555 555,720 720,840

2309
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:01,310
0,120 120,395 415,690 690,840 840,975
lock table, because that may

2310
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,075
0,105 105,210 210,525 525,630 630,765
be a proxy of the

2311
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:03,215
0,150 150,300 300,510 510,825 825,1140
amount of work that's someone's

2312
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:04,475
0,240 240,630 630,885 885,1005 1005,1260
done. {Basically,,when -} you abort

2313
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:05,750
0,180 180,455 475,810 810,1020 1020,1275
a transaction, you're losing all

2314
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,010
0,180 180,435 435,780 780,1170 1170,1260
that work, right? That'll have

2315
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:07,895
0,105 105,225 225,570 570,720 720,885
to get {redone.,So -} you're

2316
00:58:07,895 --> 00:58:09,730
0,135 135,425 745,1410 1410,1575 1575,1835
trying to optimize for that.|

2317
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,835
0,290 290,440 440,980 980,1220 1220,1445
But the balancing part is

2318
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:13,065
0,150 150,300 300,555 555,1035 1035,1230
that if you abort a

2319
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:14,400
0,275
transaction.|

2320
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,420
0,285 285,510 510,675 675,810 810,1020
That has done the least

2321
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,305
0,240 240,390 390,555 555,735 735,885
amount of work or made

2322
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:17,210
0,135 135,315 315,495 495,630 630,905
the least amount of progress.

2323
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,180
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,590 590,770
{Then,you -} could end up

2324
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,575
0,465 465,645 645,950 1000,1260 1260,1395
starving some transactions that can

2325
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,015
0,180 180,375 375,665 745,1145 1195,1440
never make progress because the

2326
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:22,680
0,195 195,545 685,1085 1135,1455 1455,1665
older transactions could always be

2327
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,760
0,165 165,330 330,620
ahead of it.|

2328
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,450
0,120 120,210 210,345 345,495 495,690
So you want to avoid

2329
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,055
0,530 700,990 990,1155 1155,1380 1380,1605
starvation and so sometimes what

2330
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:27,180
0,135 135,395 655,930 930,1035 1035,1125
you happen, what you end

2331
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,010
0,135 135,285 285,450 450,585 585,830
up doing is to say

2332
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,295
0,275 275,440 440,590 590,785 785,1235
if I'm using a timestamp

2333
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:30,435
0,210 210,675 675,825 825,960 960,1140
based protocol, which is pretty

2334
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:32,380
0,305 775,1175
common then.|

2335
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,420
0,180 180,285 285,570 570,765 765,1040
When I abort, the transaction

2336
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,960
0,305 305,610 720,995 995,1160 1160,1370
gets recent. {I,will -} keep

2337
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,715
0,240 240,525 525,1160 1330,1605 1605,1755
the original timestamp so the

2338
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:38,200
0,275 445,780 780,1050 1050,1260 1260,1485
transaction gets higher and higher

2339
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,835
0,350 880,1155 1155,1290 1290,1440 1440,1635
priority so that it has

2340
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:40,945
0,210 210,435 435,630 630,990 990,1110
some chance of finishing at

2341
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:42,180
0,150 150,330 330,510 510,785
some point in time.|

2342
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,810
0,225 225,330 330,435 435,525 525,630
If you give it a

2343
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,770
0,135 135,525 525,675 675,810 810,960
new timestamp, it may never

2344
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,740
0,180 180,470
get run.|

2345
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,240
0,305 305,610
All right.|

2346
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,590
0,400 1890,2240 2240,2480 2480,2770 2790,3110
So now, when you have

2347
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,375
0,240 240,720 720,885 885,1160 1480,1785
to undo a transaction that

2348
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,800
0,195 195,345 345,540 540,875 1135,1425
has to be killed, there

2349
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,760
0,180 180,330 330,540 540,795 795,960
are two different ways to

2350
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,690
0,105 105,345 345,630 630,795 795,930
do it. {One,is -} you

2351
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,485
0,105 105,210 210,360 360,555 555,795
could have bought the entire

2352
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:58,700
0,335
transaction.|

2353
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,430
0,195 195,500 610,1200 1200,1485 1485,1730
And in sql, you're also

2354
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,540
0,350 350,635 635,710 710,830 830,1060
allowed. {Let's,see, -} you're writing

2355
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,645
0,350 350,575 575,725 725,875 875,995
application code in which there

2356
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:03,965
0,90 90,240 240,615 615,905 1015,1320
are 10 sql statements that

2357
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:05,405
0,300 300,645 645,900 900,1185 1185,1440
the application needs, right? The

2358
00:59:05,405 --> 00:59:06,290
0,195 195,390 390,540 540,705 705,885
first one is your flight

2359
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,400
0,165 165,390 390,660 660,900 900,1110
has been confirmed, the hotel

2360
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,540
0,165 165,390 390,675 675,930 930,1140
has been {confirmed.,Stuff -} like

2361
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,210
0,290 490,795 795,1050 1050,1335 1335,1670
that, and you reach the

2362
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,475
0,320 320,590 590,1100 1100,1420 1530,1835
reach the ninth step and

2363
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:15,200
0,285 285,665 745,1145 1225,1560 1560,1725
realize the last query is

2364
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,240
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,690 690,1040
the one that {caused,trouble. -}

2365
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,300
0,260 260,380 380,530 530,665 665,770
You may want to say

2366
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,935
0,165 165,530 610,975 975,1305 1305,1635
{don't,abort -} everything. Just roll

2367
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:19,820
0,365
back.|

2368
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,940
0,225 225,360 360,620 1300,1700 1720,2120
To the previous safe point.

2369
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,315
0,230 230,320 320,545 545,1100 1100,1265
{So,you -} can explicitly put

2370
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:24,980
0,240 240,510 510,845 1195,1470 1470,1665
safe point calls so you

2371
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,820
0,195 195,330 330,525 525,720 720,840
as a program and have

2372
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,020
0,120 120,255 255,530 790,1065 1065,1200
to do {that.,And -} then

2373
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,560
0,105 105,225 225,345 345,435 435,540
you can say if it

2374
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,565
0,300 300,510 510,690 690,870 870,1005
aborts, just roll back to

2375
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,555
0,120 120,255 255,465 465,780 780,990
that and I'll retry again

2376
00:59:29,555 --> 00:59:30,840
0,180 180,330 330,555 555,905
just that last step.|

2377
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,010
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,770 770,1100
So you as an application

2378
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,645
0,615 615,825 825,1035 1035,1500 1500,1635
programmer have to explicitly put

2379
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:34,860
0,150 150,360 360,695 775,1035 1035,1215
these safe points, but there's

2380
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,940
0,90 90,350 490,780 780,945 945,1080
a mechanism so that you

2381
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,665
0,260 790,1065 1065,1200 1200,1455 1455,1725
can tell the database if

2382
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:38,535
0,135 135,270 270,390 390,675 675,870
you need to abort me,

2383
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:39,450
0,165 165,465 465,630 630,765 765,915
just abort me to this

2384
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,320
0,290
level.|

2385
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,820
0,305 305,610
All right.|

2386
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,900
0,260 260,455 455,790 840,1240
The other side of.|

2387
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,740
0,350 350,560 560,965 965,1205 1205,1700
Dealing with deadlocks is deadlock

2388
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,920
0,440
prevention.|

2389
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,000
0,365 365,620 620,830 830,935 935,1070
So what it's going to

2390
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,960
0,120 120,380
do is.|

2391
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,650
0,180 180,285 285,420 420,555 555,690
I'm going to stop the

2392
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,720
0,285 285,435 435,555 555,735 735,1070
deadlock at the first touch.|

2393
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,460
0,400
Okay.|

2394
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,935
0,350 430,830 1210,1610 1750,2295 2295,2475
And so, ah, here's what

2395
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:58,975
0,135 135,285 285,575 895,1295 1675,2040
it will do, is imagine

2396
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:00,460
0,240 240,515 745,1020 1170,1320 1320,1485
two transactions t 1 t

2397
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,580
0,290 610,1010 1510,1910 2590,2880 2880,3120
two are, ah, have come

2398
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,840
0,195 195,300 300,560
into the system.|

2399
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,180
0,320
And?|

2400
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,465
0,320 320,640 810,1210 2220,2620 2940,3245
T one is older than

2401
01:00:09,465 --> 01:00:10,860
0,210 210,515 805,1080 1080,1215 1215,1395
t two, so the first

2402
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,010
0,620 640,975 975,1215 1215,1520 1750,2150
protocol called weight die says

2403
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,180
0,400 780,1070 1070,1360 1620,1895 1895,2120
if the transaction that is

2404
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,485
0,420 420,555 555,675 675,915 915,1305
requesting has a higher priority,

2405
01:00:16,485 --> 01:00:18,240
0,240 240,450 450,725 1345,1620 1620,1755
so it's older than the

2406
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,425
0,260 310,615 615,825 825,1020 1020,1185
transaction, who already has the

2407
01:00:19,425 --> 01:00:20,340
0,275
lock?|

2408
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,630
0,350 400,690 690,990 990,1125 1125,1290
Then what I'm going to

2409
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,405
0,260 460,860 1000,1400 1690,2090 2380,2775
do is to allow that

2410
01:00:24,405 --> 01:00:27,440
0,435 435,725 1285,1685 2005,2405 2635,3035
requesting transaction. {Ah,,ah, -} ah,

2411
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,195
0,400 750,1150 1800,2090 2090,2330 2330,2675
ah, ah, then the that

2412
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:31,875
0,420 420,695 745,1035 1035,1325 1375,1680
requesting transaction can wait for

2413
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:32,540
0,305
it.|

2414
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,365
0,210 210,360 360,525 525,600 600,825
So if I'm an older

2415
01:00:33,365 --> 01:00:34,535
0,365 385,750 750,900 900,1035 1035,1170
transaction, I'm allowed to wait

2416
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:35,720
0,135 135,255 255,465 465,815 925,1185
for the younger transaction. {Who,has

2417
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,800
0,165 165,330 330,590
-} the lock?|

2418
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,925
0,275 275,425 425,680 680,800 800,965
Okay, so that's the way

2419
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,940
0,305
tie.|

2420
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,100
0,240 240,510 510,855 855,1250
The wound weight is.|

2421
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,230
0,245 245,410 410,730 930,1220 1220,1400
A little terrible, if you

2422
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:43,995
0,180 180,330 330,495 495,660 660,765
think the old and the

2423
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:45,360
0,210 210,720 720,915 915,1155 1155,1365
young analogy. {It's,like -} if

2424
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,395
0,240 240,345 345,480 480,765 765,1035
I'm the old transaction and

2425
01:00:46,395 --> 01:00:47,480
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,795 795,1085
the young person has it,

2426
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,180
0,275 275,410 410,680 680,1000
I can abort it.|

2427
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,250
0,730 1140,1445 1445,1670 1670,1835 1835,1970
Involuntarily and take away its

2428
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,280
0,470
locks.|

2429
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,830
0,290 310,675 675,885 885,1200 1200,1550
So it's called wound weight,

2430
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,085
0,275 275,440 440,605 605,815 815,1025
which means I wound the

2431
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,795
0,275 505,765 765,945 945,1175 1435,1710
transaction because I'm older and

2432
01:00:56,795 --> 01:00:57,980
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,900 900,1185
I get the locks that

2433
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,940
0,150 150,410
they have.|

2434
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,685
0,305 305,485 485,650 650,875 875,1205
Both of them will prevent

2435
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:02,095
0,285 285,570 570,840 840,1095 1095,1410
that cycle from happening, right?

2436
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:03,265
0,195 195,300 300,540 540,900 900,1170
Because the minute someone starts

2437
01:01:03,265 --> 01:01:04,165
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,645 645,900
to wait and art starts

2438
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:04,720
0,150 150,255 255,330 330,465 465,555
to form me, you're saying,

2439
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,120
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,950
whoops, let's kill it.|

2440
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,180
0,245 245,380 380,440 440,635 635,1000
So it's a little aggressive,

2441
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,395
0,400 600,890 890,1205 1205,1475 1475,1805
but it doesn't require maintaining

2442
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:10,670
0,255 255,435 435,705 705,1170 1170,1275
the weight for graphs and

2443
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,660
0,120 120,390 390,615 615,825 825,990
it doesn't require going through

2444
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,070
0,135 135,330 330,650 850,1170 1170,1410
this lock table and stuff

2445
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,990
0,210 210,500 610,1010 1450,1755 1755,1920
like that. {And,hence -} it

2446
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,190
0,240 240,750 750,870 870,1020 1020,1200
is simpler in that way,

2447
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,760
0,165 165,375 375,600 600,1130
but maybe more wasteful.|

2448
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,305
0,290 290,440 440,590 590,800 800,1025
And so if you want

2449
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:21,420
0,150 150,255 255,450 450,750 750,1115
to look at an example

2450
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,950
0,290 290,500 500,820 1140,1520 1520,1640
up over here, let's just

2451
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:26,040
0,290 880,1170 1170,1460
go look at.|

2452
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,590
0,260 610,975 975,1125 1125,1290 1290,1550
That you've got the first

2453
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,950
0,365 365,635 635,905 905,1055 1055,1250
situation where there's t one

2454
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,405
0,225 225,435 435,615 615,920 1090,1455
followed by t two, we'll

2455
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:31,905
0,245 295,600 600,1125 1125,1320 1320,1500
go by timestamp. {So,t -}

2456
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:33,360

0,320 430,735 735,945 945,1200 1200,1550
two in both these {examples.,And

2458
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,230
0,335 335,670 900,1220 1220,1475 1475,1730
-} so when t one

2459
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,850
0,255 255,590 730,1095 1095,1365 1365,1620
is waiting for t two,

2460
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:39,795
0,240 240,405 405,585 585,780 780,945
because t two already had

01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:41,415
0,135 135,375 375,675 675,995 1255,1620

0,230 580,840 840,960 960,1095 1095,1370
older so it can wait.|

2465
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,110
0,400 690,965 965,1115 1115,1280 1280,1490
But if it is wound

2466
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,000
0,320 640,960 960,1280 1420,1725 1725,1890
weight, t one will be

0,465 465,795 795,945 945,1140 1305,1580
nasty. {It'll,kill -} t 2

0,380 380,680 680,875 875,1150 1260,1660
The other way around is

2470
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,505
0,320 320,545 545,770 770,980 980,1175
t two comes in and

2471
01:01:58,505 --> 01:01:59,735
0,305 445,765 765,930 930,1035 1035,1230

2476
01:02:05,345 --> 01:02:06,320
0,135 135,315 315,540 540,840 840,975
like young people can't wait

2477
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,835
0,165 165,360 360,680 1000,1305 1305,1515
for old people and wound

2478
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:09,170
0,225 225,495 495,795 795,1110 1110,1335
weight says yeah, fine, if

2479
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,120
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,690 690,950
you're younger, you can wait.|

01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,380
0,275 275,515 515,755 755,980 980,1190
Okay, so you follow one

2481
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,250
0,120 120,270 270,660 660,735 735,870
of those protocols. {You,can -}

0,420 420,615 615,795 795,975 975,1185
mismatch like that, right? Otherwise

2483
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:15,650
0,210 210,420 420,665 865,1110 1110,1215
it won't {work.,So -} you

0,135 135,330 330,510 510,630 630,750
just follow one of {the,protocols.

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,440
0,645 645,1005 1005,1230 1230,1490 1750,2040
-} Essentially, it says as

2486
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,550
0,180 180,375 375,630 630,900 900,1110
soon as I decide in

2487
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,750
0,240 240,555 555,810 810,990 990,1200
some way in which the

2488
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,760
0,240 240,420 420,525 525,765 765,1010
direction of the arc holds

2489
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,500
0,290 290,470 470,770 770,950 950,1270
in that weights for graph.|

2490
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:24,975
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,710 710,905
As soon as I see

2491
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,325
0,180 180,510 510,755 835,1140 1140,1350
an arc happening, I stop

2492
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,100
0,305
it.|

2493
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,940
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,630 630,840
That doesn't mean the cycle

2494
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,035
0,225 225,480 480,720 720,870 870,1095

2495
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:30,330
0,150 150,660 660,855 855,960 960,1295
form {Oxford.,If -} you don't

2496
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,065
0,290 290,635 635,770 770,965 965,1175
allow arcs to form, no

2497
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:33,600
0,300 300,465 465,675 675,995
cycles will form, right?|

2498
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,865
0,275 275,410 410,545 545,785 785,1085
So you can only follow

2499
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:37,120
0,225
one.|

2500
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,140
0,245 245,350 350,610 810,1175 1175,1310
So what happens? Don't mix

2501
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:39,890
0,165 165,330 330,480 480,585 585,750
and match in the same

2502
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:40,640
0,255 255,435 435,540 540,630 630,750

0,225 225,435 435,630 630,810 810,1020
only one, otherwise it won't

2504
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,650
0,240 240,585 585,750 750,900 900,990
{work.,You'll -} get into a

2505
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,880
0,260 610,1010
mess, yeah.|

2506
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:45,930
0,335 335,515 515,620 620,800 800,920
Yep. {So,you -} can't mix

2507
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:46,920
0,165 165,345 345,540 540,780 780,990
and match and say, for

2508
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,760
0,150 150,330 330,570 570,675 675,840
this part, I'll do {that.,This

2509
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,915
0,165 165,440 460,840 840,990 990,1155
-} part, it's just like

2510
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:50,300
0,180 180,375 375,905
follow one protocol.|

2511
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,715
0,275 275,425 425,680 680,875 875,1055
So which one's better for

2512
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:54,230
0,135 135,425 805,1140 1140,1410 1410,1515
what scenario? Ah, that's a

2513
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,165
0,165 165,470 640,1040 1390,1665 1665,1935
great question and there isn't

2514
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:57,440
0,135 135,345 345,675 675,1020 1020,1275
a very, just very good

2515
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,820
0,290 490,810 810,1020 1020,1185 1185,1380
answer for both of that.

2516
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,840
0,180 180,315 315,540 540,765 765,1020
{I,think -} it's like depends

2517
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,815
0,150 150,375 375,660 660,855 855,975
on the application and the

2518
01:03:00,815 --> 01:03:03,220
0,360 360,510 510,645 645,905 2005,2405
workload and the {scenario.,But, -}

2519
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,655
0,275 275,440 440,680 680,1010 1010,1385
you know, people still research

2520
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,380
0,395 565,960 960,1305 1305,1530 1530,1725
into what ways to break

2521
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,820
0,495 495,740 850,1140 1140,1290 1290,1440
deadlocks and what to do

2522
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,080
0,165 165,440 760,1020 1020,1185 1185,1260
{with,that. -} So it's {an,open

2523
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,385
0,240 240,615 615,900 900,1065 1065,1305
-} question. But there isn't,

2524
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:11,540
0,275 445,750 750,915 915,1035 1035,1155
ah, not that I know

2525
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,875
0,135 135,300 300,590 820,1110 1110,1335
of a very a proof

2526
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:13,775
0,225 225,435 435,615 615,735 735,900
that says a is better

2527
01:03:13,775 --> 01:03:14,520
0,195 195,485
than b.|

2528
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,545
0,230 230,320 320,440 440,605 605,785
And if you find one,

2529
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:17,540
0,135 135,255 255,515
let me know.|

2530
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:19,920
0,400
Okay.|

2531
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,240
0,400
So.|

2532
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,200
0,335 335,530 530,880 1260,1550 1550,1730
We've talked about why these

2533
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,045
0,555 555,765 765,1035 1035,1430 1450,1845
guarantees why these systems work.

2534
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:26,260
0,270 270,480 480,795 795,1050 1050,1215
{You,know, -} hopefully you're getting

2535
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,445
0,350 370,675 675,855 855,1005 1005,1185
to understand that when we

2536
01:03:27,445 --> 01:03:29,275
0,285 285,555 555,845 1345,1635 1635,1830
deal with transactions, we like

2537
01:03:29,275 --> 01:03:30,790
0,195 195,735 735,915 915,1125 1125,1515
to visualize things as graphs

2538
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,245
0,150 150,510 510,660 660,920 1150,1455
and cycles are {bad.,And -}

2539
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:33,835
0,305 385,750 750,995 1075,1380 1380,1590
all that's happening across the

2540
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:34,825
0,315 315,540 540,660 660,810 810,990
dependence graphs and wait for

2541
01:03:34,825 --> 01:03:35,830
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,735 735,1005
graphs is we are trying

2542
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,555
0,290 850,1080 1080,1155 1155,1395 1395,1725
to, we are basically finding

2543
01:03:37,555 --> 01:03:38,380
0,240 240,405 405,540 540,690 690,825
ways to not have these

2544
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,560
0,300 300,480 480,770
cycles get formed.|

2545
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,000
0,290 290,580 930,1330 1950,2270 2270,2540
All right, so so far

2546
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,280
0,225 225,435 435,630 630,930 930,1280
what we've talked about is

2547
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,985
0,335 335,670 690,1130 1130,1265 1265,1505
all these schemes that we

2548
01:03:46,985 --> 01:03:49,025
0,365 775,1175 1405,1695 1695,1890 1890,2040
have have a one to

2549
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,120
0,135 135,540 540,720 720,855 855,1095
one mapping from the database,

2550
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,780
0,375 375,630 630,735 735,1160
objects to the locks.|

0,135 135,270 270,390 390,555 555,810
And if you want to

2552
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,615
0,285 285,510 510,780 780,1160 1720,2025
update a billion records, as

2553
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:55,820
0,165 165,360 360,645 645,900 900,1205
we just mentioned, ah, ah,

2554
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,210
0,320 320,470 470,620 620,800 800,920
towards the beginning of the

2555
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,605
0,260 430,735 735,960 960,1215 1215,1395
class, then we acquired a

2556
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:00,480
0,210 210,815 1135,1410 1410,1650 1650,1875
billion locks and that's very

2557
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,970
0,380 760,1160 1660,1995 1995,2280 2280,2490
expensive, right? Making changes to

2558
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,810
0,105 105,285 285,420 420,600 600,840
the hash table is pretty

2559
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,960
0,350 760,1160 1420,1725 1725,1890 1890,2150
expensive and can we do

2560
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,960
0,400
better?|

2561
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,240
0,400
So.|

2562
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,120
0,400
Um.|

2563
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,840
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,820 900,1300
There is this notion called.|

2564
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,240
0,920 1030,1380 1380,1970
Hierarchies of locking.|

2565
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:16,885
0,75 75,225 225,345 345,495 495,645
And its based on a

2566
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:19,890
0,255 255,635 715,1115 1765,2165 2605,3005
very simple observation, saying database

2567
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,415
0,400 570,935 935,1100 1100,1295 1295,1445
objects. {Let's,think -} about a

2568
01:04:21,415 --> 01:04:22,360
0,275
record.|

2569
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,580
0,470 470,695 695,980 980,1330 1770,2060
Doesn't sit by itself. {We,put

2570
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,530
0,180 180,470 490,765 765,1040 1660,1950
-} record into {pages.,We -}

2571
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,650
0,180 180,470 610,870 870,1130 1720,2120
put pages into tables, tables

2572
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,400
0,245 245,940 1140,1415 1415,1550 1550,1670
into databases, so we have

2573
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,540
0,105 105,855 855,1190
a hierarchical structure.|

2574
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,070
0,290 400,690 690,1095 1095,1380 1380,1530
For how we've organized the

2575
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,020
0,260
data.|

2576
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,550
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,755 755,1340
And in fact, that hierarchical

2577
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:37,590
0,180 180,330 330,540 540,765 765,1040
structure is also how we

2578
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,340
0,305 305,485 485,725 725,1090
access the data, right?|

2579
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,275
0,150 150,440 1030,1410 1410,1725 1725,1935
In the execution code that

2580
01:04:41,275 --> 01:04:42,280
0,150 150,345 345,525 525,630 630,1005
you wrote for your operators,

2581
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,315
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,825 825,1035
you'll open a file and

2582
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:44,880
0,240 240,585 585,690 690,935
start scanning the record.|

2583
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,825
0,290 290,485 485,605 605,740 740,845
First you'll start with the

2584
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:47,480
0,245 265,555 555,780 780,1115 1255,1655
database, then the the table,

2585
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,010
0,320 320,635 635,905 905,1180 1380,1670
and then the pages, and

2586
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,150
0,180 180,315 315,560 760,990 990,1140
then the records, so you're

2587
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,220
0,230 250,525 525,1170 1170,1490 1810,2070
following that hierarchical structure. {So,the

2588
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,710
0,135 135,360 360,710 790,1140 1140,1490
-} question is, can we?|

2589
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,865
0,350 350,700 1200,1625 1625,2030 2030,2165
Try to acquire locks at

2590
01:04:57,865 --> 01:05:00,200
0,275 295,1505
different granularities.|

2591
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,160
0,245 245,365 365,530 530,695 695,830
So I could have a

2592
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,525
0,210 210,495 495,830 850,1125 1125,1365
page level lock, a record

2593
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:03,905
0,300 300,635 655,930 930,1140 1140,1380
level lock, a sorry a

2594
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:05,540
0,300 300,660 660,945 945,1265 1345,1635
at column level lock, but

2595
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,970
0,285 285,555 555,795 795,1095 1095,1430
also a table level lock

2596
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,650
0,380 380,620 620,880 930,1265 1265,1600
or a database level lock.|

2597
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,200
0,380 760,1095 1095,1350 1350,1560 1560,1920
And allow mix and matching

2598
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,595
0,120 120,285 285,450 450,710 1090,1395
of all of those. {Oh,,and

2599
01:05:12,595 --> 01:05:13,570
0,195 195,345 345,480 480,690 690,975
-} by the way, let's

2600
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,950
0,180 180,465 465,800 880,1185 1185,1380
also have different types of

2601
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,240
0,495 495,780 780,945 945,1080 1080,1290
locks, some that are more

2602
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,335
0,390 390,555 555,720 720,915 915,1095
{relaxed.,So -} that sounds {like,bizarre.

2603
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:18,700
0,525 525,750 750,960 960,1110 1110,1365
-} But that's why the,

2604
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,905
0,255 255,735 735,1010 1240,1640 1810,2205
the breakthrough that ah, this

2605
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:22,135
0,300 300,600 600,900 900,1095 1095,1230
this paper had and the

2606
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,140
0,135 135,300 300,690 690,825 825,1005
work that IBM and Jim

2607
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,320
0,195 195,500 550,950 1060,1460 1780,2180
gray did was so exciting

2608
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,760
0,305 305,575 575,860 860,1040 1040,1300
and totally changed the field.|

2609
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,690
0,275 275,620 620,740 740,890 890,1180
So here's how it looks.|

2610
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,210
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,730 1290,1690
I have a database structure

2611
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,530
0,770 770,1460 1460,1640 1640,1930 1950,2300
hierarchy. {Databases,have -} tables, tables

2612
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,960
0,225 225,500 520,885 885,1140 1140,1430
have pages, pages have records,

2613
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,545
0,305 305,545 545,740 740,1100 1100,1355
and records have columns or

2614
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:37,680
0,485
attributes.|

2615
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,655
0,275 275,455 455,605 605,755 755,845
So now what I'm going

2616
01:05:38,655 --> 01:05:39,735
0,120 120,365 535,810 810,945 945,1080
to do is I will

2617
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:40,730
0,135 135,345 345,480 480,690 690,995
say I'm going to allow,

2618
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,620
0,400 1530,1895 1895,2120 2120,2300 2300,2390
ah, so if I've got

2619
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,225
0,135 135,410 520,810 810,1100 1330,1605
to transaction t one, if

2620
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:46,755
0,150 150,345 345,665 775,1205 1225,1530
it wants to acquire a

2621
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:48,360
0,300 300,630 630,965 1105,1470 1470,1605
table level lock, it's kind

2622
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,290
0,180 180,405 405,600 600,750 750,930
of like I can lock

2623
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,030
0,150 150,360 360,705 705,1005 1005,1740
the table object and implicitly

2624
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,220
0,165 165,405 405,735 735,930 930,1190
it's locked everything below it.|

2625
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,790
0,350 350,575 575,770 770,920 920,1150
Okay, so now, instead of

2626
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,930
0,425 425,560 560,845 845,1240 1590,1940
locking a billion records, I'll

2627
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,875
0,135 135,330 330,465 465,705 705,945
just lock the table because

2628
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:58,780
0,165 165,405 405,510 510,630 630,905
I'm scanning the whole table.|

2629
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,415
0,335 335,650 650,1030 1230,1505 1505,1625
Way cheaper, right? And I

2630
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,300
0,105 105,345 345,615 615,765 765,885
can make everything that we

2631
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,680
0,195 195,480 480,830
talked about correct?|

2632
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,090
0,320 320,575 575,740 740,950 950,1130
And we'll talk about this

2633
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,095
0,390 390,510 510,615 615,780 780,1005
protocol at a very high

2634
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,385
0,305 415,765 765,840 840,1005 1005,1290
level. {There's,a -} whole paper

2635
01:06:07,385 --> 01:06:08,180
0,225 225,360 360,510 510,660 660,795
on {it.,It -} takes a

2636
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,215
0,150 150,435 435,690 690,855 855,1035
full lecture to go {through,this.

2637
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,745
0,275 385,705 705,1020 1020,1395 1395,1530
-} And again, that's going

2638
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:11,435
0,105 105,180 180,360 360,555 555,690
to be talked about in

2639
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,280
0,135 135,395 1015,1410 1410,1695 1695,1845
the {database,systems -} class. But

2640
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,240
0,210 210,405 405,525 525,630 630,960
hopefully you get the intuition

2641
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,640
0,210 210,345 345,495 495,770
for how it works.|

2642
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,640
0,380 790,1185 1185,1530 1530,1740 1740,2000
So database systems will actually

2643
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,955
0,320 320,575 575,785 785,995 995,1295
allow things like that. {They'll,say,

2644
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:19,720
0,120 120,270 270,405 405,585 585,765
-} you know what, you

2645
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,720
0,260 700,1095 1095,1365 1365,1725 1725,2000
can the, the locking mechanism

2646
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,200
0,620 620,860 860,1025 1025,1175 1175,1310
internally can lock at the

2647
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,325
0,255 255,570 570,750 750,900 900,1125
database level, which is pretty

2648
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:25,735
0,335 535,795 795,975 975,1185 1185,1410
{rare.,We -} talked about how

0,225 225,405 405,570 570,705 705,960
they allowed at the database

2653
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,100
0,315 315,650
to implement.|

2654
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,060
0,245 245,350 350,515 515,710 710,920
And of course they change

2655
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,305
0,315 315,660 660,810 810,1020 1020,1245
the it's easy to implement,

2656
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:35,385
0,180 180,375 375,765 765,930 930,1080
you get correctness, but no

2657
01:06:35,385 --> 01:06:37,280
0,555 555,735 735,1020 1020,1380 1380,1895
parallelism, right? So performance suffers.|

2658
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,685
0,290 310,710 730,1130 1210,1545 1545,1785
But database systems now have

2659
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:41,635
0,210 210,840 840,1065 1065,1605 1605,1950
these hierarchy of blocking. {Table,level

imagine, the first time you

2666
01:06:49,075 --> 01:06:49,795
0,225 225,330 330,465 465,615 615,720

0,225 225,360 360,570 570,885 885,1140

0,105 105,300 300,495 495,740 790,1155

2673
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,200
0,260 260,470 470,700 810,1210 1320,1670
If you're doing a record

2674
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,715
0,270 270,800 820,1125 1125,1290 1290,1515
level locking, then when you're

2675
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:02,050
0,345 345,480 480,755 775,1125 1125,1335
scanning the records in the

0,165 165,300 300,560 700,1095 1095,1490

2678
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,045
0,400 450,845 845,1205 1205,1520 1520,1865
rarely, systems also do attribute

2679
01:07:07,045 --> 01:07:07,960
0,210 210,725
level locking.|

2680
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,055
0,245 245,320 320,410 410,620 620,905
So in a system that

2681
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:10,680
0,330 330,750 750,975 975,1335 1335,1625

2682
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,620
0,245 245,365 365,500 500,605 605,740
you can do a lot

2683
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,840
0,165 165,830 1150,1550
more parallelism because.|

2684
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,600
0,395 395,575 575,860 860,1130 1130,1660
I'm doing record level locking

2685
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,365
0,210 210,500 730,990 990,1110 1110,1245
2 transactions. {One,of -} them

2687
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:20,425
0,240 240,375 375,525 525,705 705,930
the other one wants to

01:07:20,425 --> 01:07:21,580
0,240 240,480 480,705 705,915 915,1155
update another {column.,They -} really

2689
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,040
0,300 300,560
don't conflict.|

2690
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,090
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,780 780,1050
But if I only do

2691
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,460
0,255 255,540 540,900 900,1065 1065,1370
record level locking, I will.|

2692
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,475
0,335 335,575 575,785 785,965 965,1175
Make them go one after

2693
01:07:27,475 --> 01:07:28,500
0,180 180,425
the other.|

2694
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,105
0,275 275,425 425,590 590,860 860,1145
So you go further down,

2695
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:31,780
0,225 225,330 330,480 480,1145
you'll get more parallelism.|

2696
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:32,785
0,260 260,455 455,635 635,830 830,935
But you'll also be do

2697
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:34,090
0,90 90,225 225,390 390,875 1045,1305
a lot more locking. {So,what

2698
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:34,810
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,555 555,720
-} you want is to

2699
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,620
0,240 240,450 450,555 555,675 675,810
allow, if you want to

2700
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,660
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,750 750,1040
do allow all of that,

2701
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,915
0,275 275,410 410,575 575,770 770,995
can you mix and match

2702
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:38,650
0,225 225,375 375,495 495,615 615,735
that? Can you get the

2703
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,865
0,165 165,360 360,555 555,990 990,1215
best of both worlds? And

2704
01:07:39,865 --> 01:07:41,280
0,120 120,285 285,480 480,755
the answer is yes.|

2705
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,480
0,290
And?|

2706
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,305
0,150 150,300 300,465 465,600 600,825
To do all of that

2707
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:44,685
0,365 715,1020 1020,1140 1140,1275 1275,1380
correctly, you're going to have

2708
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,100
0,240 240,480 480,660 660,965 1015,1415
to introduce this notion, yep.|

2709
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,355
0,105 105,240 240,495 495,860 1210,1515
But on previous slide, so

2710
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,710
0,225 225,465 465,855 855,1035 1035,1355
there now attribute level loss,

2711
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:50,360
0,290
but.|

2712
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,935
0,135 135,315 315,555 555,930 930,1575
They were below tuple hierarchies.

2713
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,525
0,225 225,375 375,525 525,785 895,1590

0,120 120,380 610,1010 1060,1350 1350,1470
have a column store or

2720
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,210
0,105 105,585 585,855 855,1220 1450,1740

0,150 150,315 315,540 540,795 795,1215
I lock an entire columnumns?

2722
01:08:06,425 --> 01:08:07,715
0,240 240,555 555,765 765,1065 1065,1290
Yes, you'll just adjust the

2723
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:09,005
0,270 270,525 525,815 865,1140 1140,1290

01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,700
0,275 355,660 660,1175 1225,1515 1515,1695
tables becomes columns and so

2725
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,275
0,270 270,615 615,825 825,1350 1350,1575
pages you'll get columns, and

2726
01:08:12,275 --> 01:08:13,580
0,335 445,720 720,1065 1065,1200 1200,1305
before below columns you might

2727
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,560
0,135 135,410
have pages.|

2728
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,150
0,305 305,530 530,800 800,1040 1040,1190
And then in that, you

2729
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,460
0,120 120,255 255,710
would have columns.|

2730
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,280
0,305 305,610
So, absolutely.|

2731
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,125
0,275 275,425 425,560 560,665 665,755
As long as you have

0,365 365,730 1140,1540 1830,2105 2105,2240

2737
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,470
0,240 240,510 510,800 910,1185 1185,1350

2738
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,700
0,180 180,450 450,705 705,945 945,1230
pretty common because column stores

2739
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,365
0,270 270,615 615,900 900,1440 1440,1665

0,345 345,435 435,540 540,645 645,765
That's the way in which

2741
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,435
0,225 225,345 345,480 480,1035 1035,1305

0,395 715,990 990,1170 1170,1415 1705,2105
Now if you're building ah,

2743
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,365
0,350 350,700 720,1070 1070,1370 1370,1595
the, the next question that

2744
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,430
0,150 150,360 360,615 615,825 825,1065
you probably have is like

2745
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,360
0,240 240,465 465,660 660,795 795,930
how common is it to

0,195 195,435 435,800 1060,1365 1365,1545
The answer is more and

2749
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:45,635
0,165 165,455 475,765 765,960 960,1170
more common because now people

2750
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:46,490
0,180 180,345 345,495 495,660 660,855
are trying to build these

2751
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,770
0,210 210,435 435,675 675,945 945,1280
things called edge tap systems.

2752
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,475
0,290 290,575 575,845 845,1055 1055,1265
{So,typically -} what people will

2753
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:50,585
0,135 135,315 315,420 420,555 555,1110
say, I've got an analytic

2754
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,365
0,195 195,390 390,555 555,645 645,780
system and I've got a

2755
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:53,180
0,275 385,785 1225,1515 1515,1650 1650,1815
transaction systems, but now I'm

2756
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,845
0,230 250,540 540,830 1330,1560 1560,1665
maintaining two {systems.,So -} an

2757

0,390 390,660 660,915 915,1050 1050,1170
edgetap system says I want

2758
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:57,860
0,150 150,315 315,605 865,1230 1230,1845
to allow transactions and analytics

2759
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,285
0,150 150,285 285,450 450,1130 1150,1425
and do that efficiently, but

2760
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:01,720
0,725 985,1560 1560,1755 1755,2055 2055,2435
analytics workloads want column stores.|

2761
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,360
0,320 610,1260 1260,1500 1500,1830 1830,2100
Whereas transactional systems want raw

0,320 700,960 960,1140 1140,1230 1230,1490
stores, so there's a huge

2763
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,000
0,290 290,530 530,770 770,950 950,1100

0,135 135,300 300,450 450,600 600,870
on how to make that

0,75 75,195 195,435 435,945 945,1050
have a storage hierarchy, you

2767
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,070
0,135 135,330 330,600 600,950 1180,1530
can make the theory of

0,150 150,440 490,810 810,1035 1035,1340
the beauty of this technique,

0,365 365,730
it it.|

0,275 275,485 485,1085 1085,1310 1310,1660
With any hierarchical data structure,

2772
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,255
0,275 275,440 440,590 590,740 740,965
but how to make edge

2773
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,665
0,255 255,575 595,945 945,1215 1215,1410
tap systems work, where I

2774
01:09:20,665 --> 01:09:21,505
0,150 150,285 285,420 420,630 630,840
might have a row store

2775
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:23,250
0,150 150,270 270,515 535,935 1345,1745
and a column store is

2776
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,450
0,380 380,665 665,970 990,1390 1440,1880
something that is being researched

2777
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,830
0,525 525,705 705,825 825,1070 1090,1380

0,275 415,705 705,995 1585,1905 1905,2225
correctly. {Okay?,Specifically,,like - -} having

01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,930
0,530 530,800 800,1115 1115,1520 1520,1820

2783
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,590
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,860 860,1130
In all APP systems, that's

2784
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:36,600
0,105 105,270 270,435 435,660 660,1010
what you would do. {Yeah,,if

0,400 540,830 830,1010 1010,1190 1190,1355
right? So there are all

2791
01:09:44,515 --> 01:09:45,505
0,180 180,435 435,660 660,780 780,990
APP systems where they say

2792
01:09:45,505 --> 01:09:46,600
0,240 240,690 690,810 810,930 930,1095
I designate you as just

read only.|

2794

And no updates. {This,means -}

2795
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,420
0,240 240,390 390,585 585,935
none of this applies.|

2796
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,160
0,320 320,640
Other questions?|

2797
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,170
0,245 245,350 350,470 470,665 665,910
Okay, and we won't finish

2798
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,875
0,350 350,700 780,1070 1070,1370 1370,1625
everything today, but that's okay.

2799
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:00,685
0,270 270,375 375,495 495,660 660,810
{Let's,see -} how much we

2800
01:10:00,685 --> 01:10:02,635
0,135 135,330 330,495 495,755 1645,1950
can get {through.,I -} keep

01:10:02,635 --> 01:10:04,000
0,270 270,630 630,885 885,1080 1080,1365
asking questions because this, this

2802
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,020
0,285 285,510 510,645 645,810 810,1020
material takes a little time

2803
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,140
0,150 150,590
to digest.|

2804
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,150
0,400 990,1265 1265,1430 1430,1610 1610,1790
So to make all these

2805
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,875
0,525 525,830 1120,1395 1395,1545 1545,1725
hierarchies work, if you just

2806
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,030
0,195 195,345 345,525 525,795 795,1155
kept a shared and exclusive

2808
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,370
0,210 210,465 465,615 615,915 915,1310
We won't get much performance

2809
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,265
0,290 290,425 425,500 500,590 590,815
because you know if someone

2810
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:17,400
0,375 375,555 555,795 795,1115

0,365 365,500 500,1085 1085,1250 1250,1430
There's no parallelism, right? So

2812
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,700
0,375 375,810 810,1005 1005,1280
it'll backfire on us.|

2813
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,675
0,225 225,360 360,540 540,765 765,975
So we need this thing

2814
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,130
0,305 355,900 900,1170 1170,1290 1290,1455
called intentional locks, which sort

2815
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:24,510
0,150 150,375 375,735 735,1080 1080,1380
of seems weird and connects

2816
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,230
0,105 105,210 210,405 405,600 600,720
to the question that was

2817
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,610
0,165 165,470 580,975 975,1245 1245,1380

0,180 180,315 315,495 495,765 765,1110

intention {to,share. -} And what

2825
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,080
0,210 210,530 550,915 915,1280
this says is look.|

2826

2828
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,995
0,245 245,395 395,470 470,575 575,695
I don't want to grab

2829
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:44,140
0,135 135,330 330,540 540,690 690,1145
a shared lock on tan.|

0,260 260,380 380,515 515,650 650,785
Because it may be too

2831
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,020
0,275 565,855 855,1125 1125,1395 1395,1545

0,120 120,300 300,555 555,855 855,1095

2834
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,165

0,225 225,405 405,690 690,960 960,1185
index and only the records

0,225 225,500 730,1065 1065,1260 1260,1485
that match, and I don't

know what will end up.

0,225 225,465 465,735 735,930 930,1080
is such that I need

0,210 210,420 420,675 675,1055 1315,1605
to access every record, or

0,165 165,300 300,480 480,735 735,930
it is so narrow that

0,135 135,375 375,630 630,885 885,1215
I might access zero records

01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:04,600
0,225 225,405 405,615 615,840 840,1035
or only one record in

2845
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,515
0,120 120,345 345,570 570,795 795,915
the table. {I,don't -} know

2846
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:06,300
0,275
that.|

2847
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,160
0,195 195,270 270,360 360,525 525,860
But I have to acquire

2848
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,235
0,320 320,530 530,695 695,815 815,935
that lock as I come

2849
01:11:08,235 --> 01:11:10,100
0,150 150,300 300,720 720,995 1465,1865
down this hierarchy first, so

2850
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:11,370
0,260 260,440 440,695 695,860 860,1040
I could acquire the shared

2851
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,375
0,180 180,315 315,435 435,645 645,1005
lock on the table. {But,that

2852
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:13,550
0,285 285,450 450,600 600,825 825,1175
-} could be really bad

2853
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,210
0,380 380,695 695,890 890,1100 1100,1430
if very few records actually

2854
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,440
0,255 255,375 375,480 480,740
need to be read.|

2855
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,535
0,320 320,590 590,665 665,815 815,905
So here's what I'm going

2856
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:18,210
0,105 105,195 195,405 405,510 510,675
to do. {I'm,going -} to

2857
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,760
0,210 210,390 390,750 750,1100 1150,1550
say I {haven't.,I -} intend

2858
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,675
0,400 630,950 950,1130 1130,1355 1355,1655
to grab a shared lock

2859
01:11:21,675 --> 01:11:23,120
0,285 285,615 615,995
somewhere down below.|

2860
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:23,870
0,165 165,270 270,405 405,570 570,750
So I will grab an

2861
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,550
0,290 490,825 825,1110 1110,1440 1440,1680
I lock an intention to

2862
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,020
0,210 210,560 910,1185 1185,1320 1320,1470
share lock and the beauty

2863
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,100
0,150 150,285 285,560 580,885 885,1080
of an is lock is

2864
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,440
0,225 225,735 735,885 885,1050 1050,1340
it's compatible with an I

2865
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,180
0,305 305,470 470,665 665,1000 1140,1540
lock, which is intention to

2866
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,005
0,400 450,755 755,950 950,1205 1205,1565
write to get an exclusive

2867
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:34,600
0,270 270,510 510,810 810,1175
lock somewhere down below.|

2868
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,010
0,225 225,500 520,855 855,1110 1110,1410
So the main line is

2869
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,080
0,255 255,435 435,630 630,795 795,1070
I could grab an is

2870
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,560
0,350 350,620 620,890 890,1205 1205,1430
lock so other readers can,

2871
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,040
0,135 135,330 330,555 555,860
of course go through.|

2872
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,015
0,345 345,435 435,570 570,750 750,975
I'm just saying I intend

2873
01:11:41,015 --> 01:11:42,200
0,150 150,395 565,885 885,1065 1065,1185
to share down when I

2874
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,370
0,195 195,390 390,585 585,830 850,1170
get below, I'll actually grab

2875
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,270
0,180 180,390 390,630 630,780 780,900
a shared lock on the

2876
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,635
0,150 150,285 285,465 465,710 1060,1365
thing that I'm reading, but

2877
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,625
0,180 180,315 315,510 510,750 750,990
at the top level I'm

2878
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:47,950
0,165 165,450 450,870 870,990 990,1325
not black blocking so I'm

2879
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,105
0,305 305,530 530,850 990,1390 1770,2045
have this fight between if

2880
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,400
0,165 165,405 405,705 705,1035 1035,1295
I just do, let's say,

2881
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,405
0,320 320,665 665,860 860,1390 1410,1715
ah, tuple level locking life

2882
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:54,995
0,180 180,375 375,615 615,935 1255,1590
is good with strict, strong,

2883
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:56,620
0,255 255,450 450,645 645,1175
strict two phase locking.|

2884
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,090
0,400 810,1070 1070,1175 1175,1280 1280,1430
But if I have to

2885
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:58,945
0,195 195,345 345,450 450,585 585,855
scan a lot of records,

2886
01:11:58,945 --> 01:12:00,130
0,270 270,555 555,900 900,1035 1035,1185
my locking overhead is too

2887
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:00,805
0,150 150,270 270,405 405,540 540,675
high. {So,I'm,trying - -} to

0,180 180,375 375,645 645,1155 1155,1425
balance the locking overhead with

2889
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,600
0,180 180,360 360,900 900,1065 1065,1370
how much parallelism I {allow.,So

2890
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:06,055
0,400 540,830 830,1120 1230,1835 1835,2105
-} the is locks come

2891
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,465
0,135 135,345 345,825 825,1125 1125,1410
in {different,flavors. -} The three

2892
01:12:07,465 --> 01:12:09,160
0,210 210,585 585,875 1045,1440 1440,1695
main flavors are intention to

2893
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,100
0,260
share.|

2894
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,845

lock somewhere below ix's intention

0,270 270,435 435,660 660,1005 1005,1305
to grab an exclusive lock

2897
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,500
0,315 315,710 1090,1410 1410,1730 1840,2220
somewhere below and shared intention

2898
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,500
0,380 1000,1395 1395,1950 1950,2330
to six locks is.|

2899
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,080
0,195 195,405 405,710 850,1215 1215,1580
I will read everything below.

2900
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,200
0,290 290,455 455,695 695,1060
{I,know -} that already.|

2901
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,250
0,195 195,480 480,735 735,900 900,1050
But some things I may

2902
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,780
0,290 430,830 1000,1245 1245,1365 1365,1530
actually update, so it may

2903
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,300
0,210 210,390 390,645 645,890
be I don't have.|

2904
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,145
0,335 335,560 560,725 725,1000 1080,1445
Index built at all, let's

2905
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:32,620
0,210 210,570 570,855 855,1110 1110,1475
say on a student record

2906
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,775
0,400 600,965 965,1330 1440,1700 1700,1805
table student table, and I

2907
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:36,220
0,135 135,285 285,545 715,1080 1080,1445
want to scan everything and

2908
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,135
0,400 420,695 695,905 905,1150 1290,1565
take everyone who's got a

0,165 165,405 405,630 630,795 795,960
b minus and move them

2910
01:12:39,095 --> 01:12:40,460
0,120 120,225 225,485 805,1080 1080,1365
to A B I don't

2911
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,510
0,195 195,465 465,705 705,930 930,1050
know which ones. {I'm,going -}

2912

0,135 135,255 255,465 465,810 810,1190
to grab an exclusive lock,

0,260 260,395 395,500 500,635 635,725
but I know I'm going

2914
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:44,800
0,120 120,365 385,785
to read everything.|

2915

0,245 245,335 335,470 470,755 755,1055
So I will say please

2916
01:12:46,045 --> 01:12:47,035
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,705 705,990
don't make me grab shared

2917
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:48,925
0,285 285,615 615,995 1255,1590 1590,1890
lock down below, assume I've

2918
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:50,545
0,455 505,905 955,1230 1230,1410 1410,1620
sharedlock everything. {So,just -} one

2919
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:51,595
0,300 300,570 570,750 750,840 840,1050
lock and let's say there's

2920
01:12:51,595 --> 01:12:52,660
0,195 195,495 495,765 765,945 945,1065
only one student that I

2921
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,485
0,135 135,330 330,525 525,675 675,825
need to update out of

2922
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:55,120
0,105 105,375 375,1260 1260,1410 1410,1635
the 100 {students.,I} will only

2923
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,790
0,285 285,620 640,1035 1035,1335 1335,1670
grab one exclusive lock later

2924
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,150
0,290 290,470 470,680 680,920 920,1100
for that one student that

2925
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:58,840
0,120 120,255 255,390 390,555 555,690
I need to {change.,So -}

2926
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,150
0,135 135,315 315,615 615,855 855,1310
it's very efficient, two locks,

2927
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,855
0,400 510,845 845,1100 1100,1280 1280,1475
right, as opposed to having

2928
01:13:01,855 --> 01:13:03,660
0,195 195,455 565,1050 1050,1335 1335,1805
to grab 100 plus locks.|

2929
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,445
0,400 540,940 1050,1340 1340,1535 1535,1745
Okay, so how does that

2930
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:08,215
0,305 655,915 915,1035 1035,1140 1140,1770
work? We need a compatibility

2931
01:13:08,215 --> 01:13:09,750
0,605 715,990 990,1125 1125,1260 1260,1535
matrix before we can proceed.|

2932
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,900
0,395 395,665 665,1310 1310,1955 1955,2240
And that compatibility matrix has

2933
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,220
0,150 150,410 460,810 810,1110 1110,1320
a couple interesting points that

2934
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:14,955
0,180 180,300 300,450 450,570 570,735
I'd like to draw your

2935
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:16,455
0,285 285,665 925,1200 1200,1350 1350,1500
attention to. {One,is -} that

2936
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:18,375
0,195 195,515 745,1095 1095,1335 1335,1920
an is lock is compatible

2937
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,120
0,135 135,270 270,750 750,1115
with an ix lock.|

2938
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,185
0,120 120,300 300,525 525,765 765,1065
And what that is saying

2939
01:13:21,185 --> 01:13:23,030
0,285 285,575 685,1085 1195,1545 1545,1845
is that yes, you intend

0,165 165,270 270,875 985,1275 1275,1455
in the hierarchy, you will

2943

0,165 165,315 315,585 585,990 990,1385
to grab an exclusive lock

2948

0,395 395,790 870,1160 1160,1355 1355,1580
down below, they could say

2949
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,270
0,210 210,405 405,630 630,885 885,1020
at this level I'm just

2950
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,290
0,150 150,465 465,645 645,795 795,1020
an ix lock and I

2951
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,100
0,240 240,555 555,870 870,1520
and ix locker compatible.|

2952

0,275 275,485 485,605 605,755 755,890
And you'll see that with

2953
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,160
0,195 195,530 760,1035 1035,1215 1215,1410
an example. {And,then -} the

2954
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,795
0,285 285,645 645,900 900,1500 1500,1635
six lock is compatible with

0,135 135,390 390,750 750,1115 1315,1680
the is lock because six

2956
01:13:48,475 --> 01:13:49,765
0,270 270,495 495,815 865,1185 1185,1290
lock is like I've got

2957
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:50,710
0,120 120,270 270,435 435,660 660,945
a shared lock on everything

2958

0,300 300,525 525,630 630,795 795,975
{below.,So -} of course, read

0,150 150,645 645,780 780,915 915,1175
is compatible with a read,

0,225 225,485 655,960 960,1260 1260,1590
to read, and so that

2962
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:58,020
0,210 210,435 435,1175
is also compatible.|

2963
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,955
0,350 350,700 1380,1790 1790,2030 2030,2375
Okay, so let's see you've

2964
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:02,170
0,135 135,345 345,665 745,1035 1035,1215
got five minutes. {That,should -}

2965
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,085
0,165 165,345 345,495 495,675 675,915
be enough to go through

2966
01:14:03,085 --> 01:14:03,895
0,165 165,300 300,420 420,570 570,810
some of the core parts

2967
01:14:03,895 --> 01:14:04,860
0,335
here.|

2968
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,540
0,210 210,345 345,570 570,920 1330,1680
Let's take this example of

2969
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,810
0,285 285,465 465,710 790,1190 1450,2270
getting a balance from Andy's

2970
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,380

0,245 245,425 425,530 530,665 665,875
I don't think he really

2972
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:13,390
0,240 240,435 435,660 660,780 780,975
has one, there's just an

2973
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,320
0,320 340,740
example, so.|

2974
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,930
0,365 365,500 500,710 710,965 965,1210
Don't tell people it's real.

2975
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,665
0,400 570,875 875,1115 1115,1370 1370,1565
{Ah,,and -} then increase the

2976
01:14:18,665 --> 01:14:19,940
0,360 360,585 585,840 840,1095 1095,1275
bookies account balance by one

2977
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,565
0,290 790,1190 2020,2400 2400,2505 2505,2625
percent and let's go and

2978
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:23,570
0,150 150,375 375,615 615,810 810,1005
look at what that looks

2979
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:24,785
0,180 180,315 315,495 495,740 940,1215
{like.,So -} we've got a

2980
01:14:24,785 --> 01:14:26,735
0,275 415,705 705,915 915,1235 1585,1950
table of all these bank

2981
01:14:26,735 --> 01:14:28,775
0,365 415,815 1225,1590 1590,1890 1890,2040
account information and we'll start

2982
01:14:28,775 --> 01:14:30,065
0,165 165,270 270,450 450,785 925,1290
with the first transaction to

2983
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,620
0,315 315,585 585,905
read that record.|

2984
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,610
0,165 165,345 345,585 585,780 780,990
At that point, we might

2985
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:33,570
0,300 300,540 540,675 675,795 795,960
only want to read that

2986
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,530
0,195 195,465 465,690 690,825 825,960
one record. {So,what -} we

2987
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:35,805
0,150 150,440 490,795 795,1020 1020,1275
might say is at that

2988
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,275
0,225 225,525 525,675 675,965 1165,1470
I declare an is walk

2989
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:38,480
0,165 165,270 270,515
on the table.|

2990
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,160
0,320 320,640 960,1220 1220,1385 1385,1640
And then, you know, assuming

2991
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,315
0,255 255,405 405,615 615,855 855,1155
there's only one Andy, I'm

2992
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:42,020
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,540 540,705
only going to read that

2993
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,765
0,195 195,680 880,1280 1390,1790 2440,2745
one tuple and basically write

2994
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:45,770
0,195 195,420 420,735 735,870 870,1005
a shared locks. {So,two -}

2995
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,195
0,255 255,465 465,710 1000,1260 1260,1425
locks I'm {done.,And -} then

2996
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:47,840
0,150 150,240 240,345 345,480 480,645
if I had to scan

2997
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,980
0,210 210,450 450,720 720,975 975,1140
the entire table, I'll only

2998
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,030
0,285 285,540 540,795 795,915 915,1050
grab shared locks on what

2999
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,000
0,120 120,285 285,590
I need to.|

3000
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,550
0,400 450,740 740,905 905,1130 1130,1480
Now, at the same time,

3001
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,330
0,260 260,725 725,860 860,1025 1025,1610
the parallelism that is allowable

3002
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,680
0,315 315,555 555,705 705,980 1060,1350
here is that transaction t

3003
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,645
0,180 180,345 345,720 720,1580 1690,1965
two could beok concurrently while

3004
01:14:57,645 --> 01:14:58,640
0,195 195,480 480,585 585,720 720,995
those locks are being held

3005
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,075
0,305 305,500 500,680 680,845 845,1235
and can grab an ix

3006
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,040
0,335
lock.|

3007
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,955
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,765 765,915
And as long as it

3008
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:02,900
0,165 165,345 345,540 540,750 750,945
does not want to update

3009
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,180
0,165 165,440 760,1160 1630,1980 1980,2280
the same record that is

3010
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,265
0,555 555,800 1180,1485 1485,1785 1785,2085
Andy's record, that transaction is

3011
01:15:07,265 --> 01:15:08,580
0,195 195,345 345,605
allowed to proceed.|

3012
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,570
0,240 240,345 345,465 465,630 630,810
We're at the level of

3013
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,640
0,120 120,380 670,1020
the table it.|

3014
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,780
0,380 380,680 680,890 890,1010 1010,1100
Million going down to the

3015
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,440
0,195 195,285 285,390 390,540 540,660
bottom of if they're two,

3016
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,220
0,165 165,300 300,450 450,630 630,780
we want to grab an

3017
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,120
0,240 240,540 540,675 675,780 780,900
is slot. {To,be -} sure

3018
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,780
0,105 105,225 225,375 375,510 510,660
you have to, for some

3019
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,830
0,165 165,495 495,570 570,750 750,1050
reason, modify the actual table

3020
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:17,720
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,630 630,890
itself you want to grab.|

3021
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,780
0,400
Excellent.|

3022
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,490
0,400 510,785 785,920 920,1100 1100,1420
Yeah. {So,the -} question is,

3023
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,375
0,275 275,440 440,605 605,830 830,1175
if you know you're modifying

3024
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,155
0,120 120,300 300,495 495,630 630,780
the table, can you grab

3025
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:26,745
0,210 210,575 595,995 1165,1440 1440,1590
an exclusive lock? So there

3026
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:27,855
0,150 150,425 445,795 795,1005 1005,1110
are some situations where you

3027
01:15:27,855 --> 01:15:28,760
0,120 120,255 255,390 390,585 585,905
would do {that.,For -} {example,,maybe.

3028
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,420
0,400 570,860 860,1130 1130,1280 1280,1400
-} And that's again a

3029
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,545
0,260 400,660 660,855 855,990 990,1125
maybe if I'm trying to

3030
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:32,550
0,90 90,240 240,615 615,825 825,1005
make a schema change to

3031
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,660
0,105 105,350 550,825 825,960 960,1110
the table, that means I'm

3032
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,040
0,90 90,195 195,440 580,980 1090,1380
going {to,change -} everything. And

3033
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,820
0,165 165,345 345,510 510,645 645,780
for that you would say,

3034
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,435
0,135 135,255 255,375 375,510 510,615
oh, I would need to

3035
01:15:36,435 --> 01:15:37,485
0,120 120,330 330,660 660,900 900,1050
grab an exclusive lock on

3036
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:38,380
0,120 120,365
the table.|

3037
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,775
0,380 400,675 675,855 855,1140 1140,1395
So if you know that

3038
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:40,680
0,195 195,330 330,495 495,630 630,905
you're going to make changes

3039
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,535
0,400 570,950 950,1330 1440,1715 1715,1835
to everything below, then you

3040
01:15:42,535 --> 01:15:43,810
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,1050 1050,1275
would stop the hierarchy and

3041
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,980
0,285 285,390 390,650 670,990 990,1170
grabbed the lock. {Nothing,in -}

3042
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,440
0,105 105,555 555,960 960,1155 1155,1460
the hierarchical locking say is

3043
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,755
0,290 290,440 440,725 725,905 905,1295
that I couldn't have grabbed

3044
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:48,685
0,135 135,345 345,555 555,720 720,930
an X lock on table

3045
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:49,975
0,335 475,720 720,855 855,1080 1080,1290
r, so it depends upon

3046
01:15:49,975 --> 01:15:50,790
0,120 120,300 300,435 435,570 570,815
what I'm trying to do.|

3047
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,100
0,400 750,1150
Yep, so.|

3048
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,400
0,290 610,1010 1270,1560 1560,1725 1725,2000
This situation, is it possible

3049
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,020
0,260 260,425 425,605 605,880
for us to just?|

3050
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,280
0,580 690,1040
Logs all.|

3051
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,475
0,320 320,500 500,680 680,905 905,1205
Until we need to write

3052
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,765
0,300 300,510 510,690 690,930 930,1290
because like for example, in

3053
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:05,120
0,315
our.|

3054
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,775
0,400 540,800 800,980 980,1190 1190,1535
Yeah, so you're saying, should

3055
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:08,935
0,365 565,885 885,1205 1495,1830 1830,2160
transaction t two have grabbed

3056
01:16:08,935 --> 01:16:10,825
0,120 120,360 360,725 1015,1415 1615,1890
a read lock on the

3057
01:16:10,825 --> 01:16:12,355
0,330 330,525 525,735 735,1025 1135,1530
tuple n and then upgraded

3058
01:16:12,355 --> 01:16:13,380
0,210 210,315 315,495 495,720 720,1025
to an X lock later?|

3059
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,340
0,400
Or.|

3060
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,705
0,270 270,480 480,740 790,1230 1230,1365
Sure, but also, couldn't I

3061
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,030
0,180 180,485 505,840 840,1050 1050,1325
just like both of these

3062
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,540
0,400
transactions?|

3063
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,665
0,365 365,605 605,845 845,1115 1115,1355

01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,805
0,380 380,635 635,755 755,890 890,1145
Yeah, because we did that

3066
01:16:23,805 --> 01:16:24,980
0,240 240,495 495,875
sort of for.|

3067
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,430
0,165 165,440 460,750 750,900 900,1050
The people screen for the

01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,005
0,290 430,860 1090,1380 1380,1515 1515,1575
yep, yepup and what are

3069
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:29,270
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,635 865,1265
you're trying to get? So,

3070
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,540
0,290 290,470 470,665 665,920 920,1220
but that would prevent someone

3071
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,860
0,240 240,420 420,710 760,1095 1095,1320
from doing an update. {This,would

3072
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,105
0,165 165,330 330,620 760,1050 1050,1245
-} not happen if both

3073
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:35,235
0,180 180,455 1045,1445 1645,1950 1950,2130
of them {see.,Right -} now

3074
01:16:35,235 --> 01:16:36,750
0,180 180,375 375,665 745,1145 1255,1515
we allowed an update to

3075
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,890
0,135 135,410 460,810 810,1020 1020,1140
a record happen at the

3076
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,050
0,165 165,330 330,465 465,740 760,1160
same time as a read

3077
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,460
0,305 305,530 530,850
to another record.|

3078
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,980
0,305 305,610 690,1040 1040,1265 1265,1430
We allowed update if I

3079
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,255
0,315 315,495 495,750 750,1050 1050,1275

01:16:43,255 --> 01:16:44,580
0,120 120,345 345,690 690,990 990,1325
the table. {No,updates -} can

3081
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,200
0,400 870,1160 1160,1310 1310,1570 2070,2360
happen on the records, right?

3082
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,370
0,270 270,555 555,720 720,915 915,1170
So look what happened here,

3083
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,900
0,225 225,530 640,1040 1090,1365 1365,1530
right? We allowed as long

3084
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,040
0,195 195,465 465,720 720,915 915,1140
as they're touching different parts

3085
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,835
0,150 150,255 255,390 390,615 615,795
of the same table, we

3086
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:52,900
0,105 105,345 345,570 570,825 825,1065
said it's {okay.,And -} this

3087
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,720
0,570 570,855 855,1080 1080,1400
hierarchical locking allows that.|

3088
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,720
0,290 290,785 785,935 935,1100 1100,1280
So logically, we still need

3089
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,090
0,285 285,585 585,780 780,1020 1020,1370
to have, like, the intention.|

3090
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,265
0,400 510,785 785,935 935,1370 1370,1655
Yes. {So,the -} protocol is

3091
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:01,960
0,375 375,495 495,705 705,1025
you'll go down the.|

3092
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,290
0,820 1020,1355 1355,1550 1550,1810 1860,2260
Hierarchy of the database structure.|

3093
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,960
0,275 275,550 660,1060 1080,1385 1385,1690
You can issue an I

3094
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,665
0,400 540,940 990,1295 1295,1475 1475,1655
lock I lock or six,

3095
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:09,430
0,195 195,360 360,495 495,615 615,765
lock any of the lock

3096
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,940
0,270 270,390 390,585 585,920
modes we talked about.|

3097
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,140
0,320 320,515 515,650 650,815 815,1100
But if you do an

3098
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,880
0,375 375,765 765,1110 1110,1455 1455,1740
intention lock, then down below

3099
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,795
0,165 165,345 345,540 540,705 705,915
you must grab a proper

3100
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:15,545
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,645 645,750
lock. {So,if -} you do

3101
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:16,340
0,105 105,315 315,525 525,630 630,795
an is or an X

lock, you must grab a

01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,755
0,240 240,480 480,615 615,795 795,1080
s or an X lock

3104
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:20,020
0,365 595,995
below, right?|

3105
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,080
0,335 335,515 515,755 755,1085 1085,1420
Yeah, the benefit is imagine

3106
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,055
0,320 320,670 690,1090 1140,1475 1475,1955
this query. {So,here -} let's

3107
01:17:29,055 --> 01:17:30,165
0,285 285,435 435,630 630,900 900,1110
go to this example and

3108
01:17:30,165 --> 01:17:31,010
0,135 135,270 270,405 405,555 555,845
that will make it {clear.,Okay,

3109
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,835
0,400 450,850 900,1235 1235,1460 1460,1565
-} so imagine I've got

0,240 240,480 480,660 660,825 825,960
after this slide and pick

3113
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,260
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,465 465,630
it up in the next

0,210 210,405 405,660 660,855 855,1065
the records and update only

0,400 720,1025 1025,1330 1950,2285 2285,2480
Okay, so now imagine this

3119
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:45,760
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,765 765,870

it. {So,here -} what we

0,210 210,330 330,540 540,735 735,885
But the record, you want

01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,105
0,150 150,345 345,695 925,1325 1405,1680

0,400 480,815 815,1150 1200,1490 1490,1655
And another transaction could come

3138
01:18:11,435 --> 01:18:12,350
0,240 240,480 480,645 645,795 795,915

So more parallelism is being

More parallelels is allowed because

its work till it gets

3157

0,120 120,360 360,525 525,780 780,1130

that last transaction, if it

0,210 210,465 465,705 705,960 960,1235
so it'll wait for that.|

3166
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,560
0,210 210,435 435,675 675,1010 1360,1760

0,290 290,485 485,740 740,965 965,1100

0,395 395,665 665,785 785,890 890,995
So, you know, you could

0,120 120,315 315,570 570,905 1435,1800

the {transaction.,So -} wanted to

0,135 135,410 520,765 765,885 885,1095
do that if it wanted

01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,730
0,180 180,425 475,765 765,1005 1005,1355
to say I want to

0,400 600,935 935,1130 1130,1325 1325,1460
go and I don't mind

3181
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,245
0,165 165,300 300,555 555,825 825,945
paying the cost for the

0,425 505,765 765,870 870,1005 1005,1140
locks because I wanted to

3183
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:17,240
0,120 120,270 270,525 525,750 750,855
get {this,balance. -} You could

3184
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:17,975
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,480 480,735
do that, but you probably

3185
01:19:17,975 --> 01:19:19,055
0,390 390,525 525,705 705,885 885,1080
wouldn't do that because it'd

3186
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,140
0,105 105,225 225,600 600,780 780,1085
make the {protocol,very -} hard.

3187
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,725
0,350 350,700 750,1025 1025,1160 1160,1325
But essentially what you saw

3188
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:23,405
0,305 505,840 840,1065 1065,1355 1405,1680
here, even with transaction t

3189
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,060
0,150 150,330 330,620 880,1200 1200,1520
1 t two is that.|

3190
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,680
0,350 350,590 590,935 935,1210
Very few locks were.|

3191
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,440
0,380 380,605 605,880 1320,1625 1625,1820
Requests were made and you

0,195 195,405 405,615 615,780 780,1460

0,275 275,440 440,680 680,905 905,1055
So you really get a

3194
01:19:34,305 --> 01:19:35,930
0,195 195,510 510,870 870,1230 1230,1625
much higher performance database system

0,275 275,410 410,545 545,800 800,1055
than you would get through

3196
01:19:37,245 --> 01:19:38,025
0,105 105,255 255,480 480,645 645,780

0,255 255,420 420,630 630,975 975,1170
didn't have the intentional locks

0,120 120,725 1045,1320 1320,1485 1485,1680
and hierarchies, you will not

0,195 195,360 360,555 555,750 750,1445
