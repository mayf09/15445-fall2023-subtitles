0,365 365,980 980,1325 1325,1625 1625,1960
Clearly violating fire code here.|

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,310
0,290 290,485 485,635 635,755 755,890
I guess you can kind

3
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,970
0,105 105,255 255,405 405,510 510,660
of maybe sit up there

4
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,025
0,165 165,440 1630,1875 1875,1965 1965,2055
up front or you sit

00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,610
0,75 75,195 195,485 1855,2220 2220,2585
on the floor, right? So

6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,150
0,260 260,410 410,545 545,650 650,800
a lot to talk about.

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,930
0,150 150,225 225,435 435,675 675,780
First of all, we have

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,835
0,120 120,435 435,2295 2295,2570 7600,7905

00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,580
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,450 450,875
to do a quick preview?

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,620
0,400
Do.|

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,285
0,320 320,545 545,830 830,1100 1100,1265
The big announcement, too, is

13
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:01,250
0,210 210,375 375,465 465,645 645,965
that for the first time

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,540
0,290 290,485 485,725 725,965 965,1270
we now have two faculty

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,385
0,400 1800,2210 2210,2555 2555,2705 2705,2795
teaching. Jesh Patel is in

16
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,640
0,105 105,255 255,435 435,725
the front row here.|

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,260
0,850 930,1330 3480,3815 3815,4010 4010,4190
Wisconsin. Ah, we're happy that

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,935
0,165 165,330 330,495 495,615 615,675
he's here, so he'll be

19
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,590
0,120 120,395 985,1260 1260,1395 1395,1655
help me throughout the lecture.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,060
0,400 750,1150
Okay, so.|

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,130
0,260 260,425 425,730 780,1115 1115,1810
As I post on piazza,

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,440
0,520 540,940 960,1360 1440,1835 1835,2230
there's another course lecture we.|

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
0,225 225,330 330,525 525,720 720,840
They get m out of

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
0,260
jail.|

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,895
0,260 260,395 395,670 1110,1340 1340,1445
Of the course. So we're

26
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:31,450
0,60 60,135 135,210 210,330 330,555
not going to go over

27
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,200
0,240 240,375 375,495 495,615 615,750
like a bunch of those

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,565
0,285 285,555 555,750 750,1070 1120,1365
things all over again. I

29
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:34,105
0,75 75,135 135,195 195,330 330,540
just want to cover some

30
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:34,945
0,225 225,465 465,645 645,750 750,840
things that if you might

31
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:35,820
0,90 90,335
have missed.|

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,570
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,525 525,750
That are important to understand

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,470
0,210 210,375 375,600 600,810 810,900
throughout this lecture, and then

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,745
0,255 255,510 510,660 660,920 970,1275
we'll jump right into the

35
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,800
0,305
material.|

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,610
0,275 275,440 440,560 560,635 635,770
All right, so the first

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,270
0,165 165,285 285,375 375,480 480,660
thing, we have a course

38
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,860
0,560 790,1170 1170,1550
sponsor, single store.|

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,115
0,305 305,515 515,785 785,1115 1115,1415
Cloud based database system that

40
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:47,570
0,335 415,645 645,720 720,990 990,1455
supports sort of hybrid workloads

41
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,490
0,290 430,1160 1420,1665 1665,1800 1800,1920
transactions analytics as I said

42
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,705
0,75 75,165 165,330 330,650 970,1215
in the first lecture, it

43
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:52,040
0,105 105,330 330,615 615,935 955,1335
is a in memory column

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,180
0,270 270,420 420,660 660,960 960,1140
store that uses skip list

45
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,700
0,225 225,435 435,570 570,830 1090,1520
with just in time query.|

46
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,925
0,420 420,630 630,905 1285,1560 1560,1680
Distribute, share nothing. If none

47
00:01:57,925 --> 00:01:58,660
0,75 75,165 165,375 375,615 615,735
of that means anything to

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,880
0,90 90,225 225,500 580,960 960,1220
you right now, that's fine.|

49
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,650
0,400 1500,1790 1790,1925 1925,2000 2000,2060
Things coming at the end

50
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,295
0,60 60,135 135,390 390,555 555,645
of the semester to give

51
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:04,840
0,105 105,270 270,575
a guest lecture.|

52
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,100
0,230 230,460 840,1130 1130,1355 1355,1690
For ah, a long time.

53
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,780
0,400 870,1130 1130,1250 1250,1355 1355,1550
The, you can call it

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,800
0,285 285,660 660,765 765,870 870,1020
men sql and then they

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,565
0,165 165,285 285,405 405,555 555,765
change the name to single

56
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,155
0,335 715,1005 1005,1095 1095,1350 1350,1590
store it. So it's, it's

57
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:13,620
0,90 90,225 225,315 315,375 375,465
a state of the art

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,460
0,195 195,450 450,690 690,750 750,840
database system that's going to

59
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,600
0,260 370,690 690,765 765,885 885,1140
cover that's going to incorporate

60
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,190
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,360 360,590
a lot of the images

61
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,300
0,400 600,980 980,1300 1320,1655 1655,1910
that we'll discuss throughout the

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,420
0,380
semester.|

63
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,085
0,260 260,410 410,575 575,850 900,1235
The crowd is huge, obviously

64
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:22,950
0,255 255,575 1285,1530 1530,1620 1620,1865
not everyone. If you hear

65
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,635
0,290 290,350 350,410 410,500 500,605
you're trying to got the

66
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,315
0,425 805,1065 1065,1245 1245,1455 1455,1680
waitlist, the bad news is

67
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,275
0,270 270,450 450,690 690,795 795,960
because the waitlist is so

68
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,090
0,305 805,1205 1255,1560 1560,1710 1710,1815
huge, the department took it

69
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,110
0,135 135,255 255,500 670,930 930,1020
away from us and we

70
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,270
0,105 105,375 375,660 660,855 855,1160
have no control over it.|

71
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,225
0,335 335,440 440,575 575,755 755,995
They're trying to figure out

72
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,340
0,285 285,525 525,690 690,840 840,1115
like who needs to graduate,

73
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,040
0,230 230,320 320,425 425,530 530,650
who is to get the

74
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
0,210 210,585 585,660 660,780 780,960
system elective and all that

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,815
0,290 490,890 1180,1515 1515,1695 1695,1815
stuff EM. So if you

76
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:37,565
0,165 165,285 285,405 405,585 585,750
come and ask us, hey,

77
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,030
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,375 375,465
can they get off the

78
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,780
0,105 105,285 285,450 450,600 600,750
wait list? The bad news

79
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,965
0,120 120,315 315,650 670,930 930,1185
is that we we don't

80
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,930
0,165 165,360 360,695 1585,1845 1845,1965
control it anymore. The good

81
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,905
0,135 135,345 345,615 615,810 810,975
news is because we have

82
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,570
0,375 375,695 1045,1365 1365,1530 1530,1665
jesh now, that will be

83
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,160
0,225 225,450 450,740 910,1275 1275,1590
teaching this class once every

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,150
0,270 270,630 630,840 840,900 900,990
every semester. So if you

85
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,130
0,225 225,330 330,435 435,585 585,980
can't get in this semester,

86
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,430
0,305 305,335 335,395 395,485 485,560
you'll be able to get

87
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,690
0,135 135,330 330,650 880,1140 1140,1260
it next semester and then

88
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,695
0,120 120,510 510,675 675,840 840,1005
the admins will move people

89
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:52,690
0,135 135,255 255,420 420,660 660,995
off the wait list as

90
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,700
0,305 305,530 530,800 800,1150
as people drop and.|

91
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,540
0,275 275,455 455,760
S become available.|

92
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
0,400 990,1390
Different where?|

93
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,490
0,550 1140,1415 1415,1565 1565,1715 1715,1850
Apartments, things I found out

94
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,780
0,120 120,210 210,435 435,710 1000,1290
since the viking faculty. So

95
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,665
0,285 285,540 540,690 690,810 810,885
again, the first of the

96
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:16,295
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,525 525,630
bad news is if you're

97
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,705
0,75 75,330 330,575 865,1230 1230,1410
not enrolled now, you're unlike

98
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:18,740
0,210 210,545
it again.|

99
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,700
0,260 260,410 410,700
In the spring.|

100
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,025
0,400 570,815 815,980 980,1250 1250,1595
Right, for all this, the

101
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,750
0,395 505,840 840,1425 1425,1650 1650,1725
the important announcements, everything will

0,260 260,365 365,485 485,620 620,800
We should talk about less

104
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,565
0,210 210,405 405,600 600,890 1060,1455
in the first lecture that's

105
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,170
0,245 535,885 885,1140 1140,1365 1365,1605

0,210 210,480 480,645 645,825 825,1020
final grades we show through

108
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,360
0,500 790,1190 1690,2090 2320,2580 2580,2700
canvas. Um, and everything will

111
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,850
0,360 360,525 525,720 720,855 855,1370
lectures that aren't at cmu

0,400 1110,1510
they outside.|

0,290 290,395 395,605 605,860 860,1180
there's a separate grade scope

118
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,255
0,350 350,545 545,635 635,770 770,935

0,195 195,420 420,630 630,935 1585,1845
using that code there and

120
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,870
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,450 450,770
you can start them and,

121
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,425
0,400 420,695 695,860 860,1150 1260,1505
and test things out and

122
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,780
0,180 180,345 345,555 555,875 955,1355
we'll release those projects as.|

123
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,100
0,260 260,485 485,850 930,1330
So in exchange for.|

0,400 870,1175 1175,1325 1325,1475 1475,1745
In making this all available

126
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,150

I don't think you have

128
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,330

there. That is sort of

131
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,355
0,305 1735,1980 1980,2100 2100,2220 2220,2310
true. But they said I

132
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:19,045
0,120 120,285 285,405 405,525 525,690
was born in the streets

133
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,350
0,135 135,585 585,870 870,1095 1095,1305
of Baltimore. I am from

134
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,940
0,590
Baltimore.|

135
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,480
0,400 870,1270 1500,1900 2130,2530 3840,4130
Um, so whatever, and someone

136
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,290
0,180 180,390 390,600 600,735 735,810
could finish that. That would

137
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,090
0,120 120,410 1300,1545 1545,1650 1650,1800
be great. And I did,

138
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,140

am. I am from just

140
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,340
0,120 120,225 225,345 345,620
not from the streets.|

141
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,880
0,400
So.|

142
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,460
0,245 245,455 455,680 680,1210 1950,2210
To cover for logistics, this

143
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,720
0,90 90,180 180,375 375,710 940,1260
is a big class. Obviously,

144
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,260
0,195 195,240 240,300 300,375 375,540
there's a lot of people

145
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,685
0,320 490,870 870,1110 1110,1245 1245,1425
here that may have different

146
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,215
0,725 805,1080 1080,1230 1230,1380 1380,1530
backgrounds. And so we want

147
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:48,085
0,120 120,300 300,510 510,690 690,870
you to interrupt us as

148
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:49,050
0,165 165,300 300,480 480,630 630,965
we're going throughout the semester.|

149
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,810
0,400 480,880 900,1300 1740,2060 2060,2380
If questions about talking about.|

150
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,970
0,455 455,760 1170,1570 1650,1985 1985,2150
Terrififying question. Um, I also

151
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,810
0,105 105,315 315,585 585,750 750,840
get very excited when I

152
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,540
0,105 105,350 970,1260 1260,1440 1440,1730
talk about again, my life,

153
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,760
0,400 660,1055 1055,1385 1385,1625 1625,1930
life, biological daughter. Number one

154
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,540
0,275 275,860 860,1055 1055,1250 1250,1520
is databases and then nothing

155
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,800
0,320 370,720 720,930 930,1125 1125,1260
else. Like I don't talk

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,080
0,290 910,1380 1380,1670 1810,2115 2115,2280
about hobbies. It literally is

157
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,780
0,120 120,680 700,1100 1360,1760 2440,2700
just databases chicken. Confirm it

158
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,310
0,135 135,270 270,705 705,980 1210,1530
is just databases. Yes, my

159
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,435
0,240 240,420 420,570 570,930 930,1125
parents are Trump supporters. We

160
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:15,200
0,150 150,300 300,435 435,555 555,765
don't talk to them like

161
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,320
0,320 1030,1305 1305,1485 1485,1755 1755,2120
like it is just business.

162
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,070
0,105 105,315 315,495 495,740 880,1280
It's funny to you, right?|

163
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,830
0,260 260,440 440,710 710,1060 2070,2470
So again, so if fast

164
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,300
0,260 260,350 350,425 425,670 750,1150
or if you have questions

165
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,440
0,275 275,550 840,1100 1100,1265 1265,1430
interrupt us, what we're not

166
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,715
0,165 165,270 270,530 670,1020 1020,1275
going to do is that

167
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:30,660
0,255 255,480 480,630 630,795 795,945
at at the end of

168
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,115
0,150 150,440 730,1005 1005,1215 1215,1455
the class, have people line

169
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:32,940
0,165 165,285 285,450 450,630 630,825
up and say, what about

170
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,060
0,320 1030,1430
slide five?|

171
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,605
0,305 305,470 470,620 620,785 785,935
The material we discussed during

172
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,490
0,135 135,375 375,630 630,750 750,885
the lecture as we go

173
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,305
0,270 270,650 1300,1575 1575,1680 1680,1815
along because want you to

174
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:41,520
0,255 255,495 495,705 705,900 900,1215
interrupt as, as, as we're

175
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,810
0,350 670,915 915,1020 1020,1140 1140,1290
talking, because if you have

176
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,725
0,255 255,480 480,615 615,765 765,915
questions and somebody else is

177
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,765
0,195 195,390 390,630 630,995 1795,2040
likely have questions too for

178
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,685
0,135 135,425 1045,1320 1320,1575 1575,1920
us to these things and

179
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:48,840
0,240 240,515 655,930 930,1050 1050,1155
discuss it. And from a

180
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,505
0,675 675,1005 1005,1320 1320,1500 1500,1665
pedagogical standpoint, it's better for

181
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,810
0,120 120,285 285,525 525,875 1015,1305
us as well because I

182
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,000
0,165 165,345 345,495 495,740
go back and watch.|

183
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,690
0,150 150,255 255,405 405,540 540,690
And I see where people

184
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,160
0,195 195,500 1030,1260 1260,1350 1350,1470
ask questions and I see,

185
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,510
0,120 120,470 610,945 945,1125 1125,1350
oh, that didn't get quite

186
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,790
0,290 430,690 690,840 840,1005 1005,1280
right, go fix the lot,

187
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,740
0,245 245,425 425,620 620,880
so having the questions.|

188
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,595
0,275 275,470 470,695 695,905 905,1175
All right. Any questions about

189
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,140
0,225 225,755
these logistics?|

190
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,625
0,400 690,935 935,1055 1055,1145 1145,1235
Boom. So let go right

191
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,770
0,120 120,315 315,635 1165,1565 1855,2145
into it. Okay, so we

192
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,810
0,75 75,300 300,630 630,810 810,1040
gonna talk about sort of.|

193
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,955
0,305 305,485 485,920 920,1130 1130,1295
Around what databaseases are, why

194
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:15,855
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,780 780,900
it's important, why we need

195
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,370
0,225 225,465 465,755 1045,1320 1320,1515
database minute systems. Why this

196
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,740
0,315 315,710 1180,1580 1960,2235 2235,2370
course exists, um, not just

197
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,685
0,135 135,270 270,420 420,615 615,945
because we do stupid niche

198
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:22,620
0,395 955,1425 1425,1635 1635,1740 1740,1935
with it's, it's a super

199
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,090
0,240 240,560 850,1140 1140,1305 1305,1470
important topic and then we'll

200
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,100
0,90 90,210 210,470
talk about the.|

201
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,875
0,260 260,440 440,755 755,1130 1130,1385
In my opinion, the the

202
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,480
0,435 435,725 1045,1320 1320,1470 1470,1605
dominant model for how you

203
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,620
0,105 105,330 330,630 630,900 900,1140
want to build or use

204
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,195
0,165 165,285 285,375 375,620 1330,1575
in in a database. Then

205
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,170
0,150 150,210 210,285 285,495 495,975
let's talk about relational algebra,

206
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,415
0,135 135,380 460,735 735,885 885,1245
the mechanism or the operators

207
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,460
0,195 195,405 405,725 1405,1725 1725,2045
we use to interact with

208
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,810
0,400 420,860 860,1115 1115,1420 1860,2180
a relational model database and

209
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,710
0,210 210,405 405,615 615,780 780,900
we finish up because we

210
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,565
0,165 165,285 285,360 360,555 555,855
have to be talking about

211
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,020
0,365 385,785 1315,1620 1620,1925
alternative models that people.|

212
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,195
0,335 335,670 1020,1355 1355,1550 1550,1685
Ational model and I have

213
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,080
0,195 195,420 420,570 570,690 690,885
strong opinions of why they're

214
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,600
0,230 490,890
wrong, okay?|

215
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
0,275 275,515 515,880
All right, so.|

216
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,405
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,695 695,785
The second most important thing

217
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,120
0,45 45,135 135,395
in my life.|

218
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,180
0,400
Yes.|

219
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,345
0,305 305,610 660,965 965,1145 1145,1295
Yes, the question is, if

220
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:05,840
0,150 150,195 195,240 240,330 330,495
you're on the wait list,

221
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,575
0,120 120,195 195,405 405,630 630,735
can you get access to

222
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:08,020
0,390 390,600 600,855 855,1080 1080,1445
piazza? Yes, we'll post the.|

223
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,570
0,260 260,380 380,515 515,695 695,1000
We make that available, yes.|

224
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:12,365
0,75 75,135 135,255 255,525 525,720
So he's a SEL server

225
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,440
0,180 180,255 255,485
in the back.|

226
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,520
0,290 290,760
My sql.|

227
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,080
0,400
Yes.|

228
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,060
0,400 930,1190 1190,1450 1470,1870 2910,3530
Anybody one more? Anybody cassandra?

229
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,640
0,320
Okay.|

230
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,545
0,335 335,695 695,970 1080,1490 1490,1685
Thing everybody listed sql server

231
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:29,260
0,390 390,815 895,1230 1230,1395 1395,1715
postgres mongo there, all database

232
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,280
0,400
systems.|

233
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,550
0,230 230,305 305,380 380,530 530,1300
Right. We're talking about databases.|

234
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,555
0,290 430,735 735,885 885,1065 1065,1335
And don't feel bad that

235
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,350
0,255 255,345 345,465 465,630 630,795
not the only one making

236
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,020
0,225 225,560 970,1230 1230,1380 1380,1670
this mistake. This is Jeff.

237
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,935
0,400 750,1130 1130,1355 1355,1505 1505,1685
Ah, but I think this

238
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,000
0,275
year.|

239
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,260
0,215 215,260 260,365 365,640
See if it plays.|

240
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,950
0,350 350,575 575,755 755,1060 1740,2000
Tech for four place a

241
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,320
0,380 430,705 705,840 840,1035 1035,1370
relational one of these systems

242
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,920
0,380 380,755 755,1115 1115,1325 1325,1460
presents the information to be

243
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,510
0,240 240,435 435,1050 1050,1230 1230,1590
stored and retrieved in rows

244
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,580
0,210 210,710 1390,1890 1890,2010 2010,2070
and columns. Justin, what is

245
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,880
0,75 75,560 1150,1550
the matrix? No.|

246
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,280
0,105 105,225 225,500 640,1040 1870,2270
It'll get worse. Okay, right?|

247
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,470
0,400 870,1220 1220,1570 1620,1910 1910,2360
Base not, again being pedantic

248
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,055
0,150 150,255 255,375 375,435 435,585
here, but it's good to

249
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:07,970
0,180 180,285 285,570 570,765 765,915
understand the distinction between the

250
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,575
0,290 910,1170 1170,1290 1290,1440 1440,1605
two, because when we just

251
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:10,280
0,105 105,195 195,315 315,480 480,705
talk about the data models,

252
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,230
0,135 135,285 285,420 420,615 615,950
you don't understand, like, okay,

253
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,500
0,230 230,380 380,455 455,620 620,890
we don't care about system

254
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,960
0,350 790,1190 1570,1875 1875,2145 2145,2460
implement yet about what data

255
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,875
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,795 795,915
actually is and how we're

256
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,570
0,45 45,150 150,315 315,450 450,695
going to interact with it,

257
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,700
0,400
so.|

258
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,280
0,400 660,1060 1080,1480 2100,2500 2820,3220
Um, organized collection of data

259
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,940
0,455 455,695 695,875 875,980 980,1220
that's related to each other,

260
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,430
0,345 345,510 510,705 705,1010 1090,1490
that's meant to model some

261
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
0,400
aspects.|

262
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,990
0,290 290,580 1170,1570 2040,2360 2360,2570
Everybody lives systems an example

263
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,145
0,135 135,285 285,590 730,1005 1005,1155
of a database that would

264
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,230
0,275 775,1110 1110,1440 1440,1830 1830,2085
be the university database that

265
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,055
0,150 150,315 315,450 450,615 615,825
keeps track of what students

266
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,230
0,225 225,690 690,780 780,900 900,1175
are enrolled in what classes

267
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,060
0,260 260,410 410,730
and your grades.|

268
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,840
0,225 225,345 345,540 540,645 645,780
Right, because that's trying to

269
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,970
0,290 1270,1515 1515,1695 1695,1890 1890,2130
model, you know, the real

270
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,520
0,380 430,1010 1180,1500 1500,1820 2260,2550
university interactions that that students

271
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,555
0,135 135,270 270,510 510,780 780,1035
are taking classes and getting

272
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,440
0,335
paid.|

273
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,620
0,400
Um.|

274
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,565
0,135 135,285 285,435 435,630 630,945
This course is so important

275
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,180
0,395 625,915 915,1205 1915,2265 2265,2615
because the database, a database,

276
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,345
0,290 290,410 410,470 470,545 545,695
is going to be the

277
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,380
0,305 1165,1565
fundamental component.|

278
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,835
0,245 245,470 470,740 740,1030 1170,1505
The underlying of any application

279
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,690
0,315 315,570 570,735 735,795 795,855
or anything you're going to

280
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,320
0,90 90,285 285,465 465,555 555,630
do with the rest of

281
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,565
0,90 90,350 730,975 975,1110 1110,1245
your life. So matter of

282
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:00,240
0,105 105,210 210,360 360,435 435,675
like if you're a CS

283
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,020
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,675 675,780
student, a matter if you

284
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,545
0,90 90,180 180,285 285,375 375,525
go off and get a

285
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,465
0,240 240,575 1225,1515 1515,1695 1695,1920
job doing and in doing

286
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:04,485
0,285 285,480 480,645 645,810 810,1020
CS related things or you

287
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,520
0,195 195,375 375,635 655,885 885,1035
you don't. Do, you know

288
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,650
0,195 195,345 345,525 525,630 630,1130
you're not not a programmer?

289
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,500
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,575 575,680
At the end of the

290
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,295
0,150 150,450 450,660 660,750 750,795
day, you're always going to

291
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:09,320
0,180 180,585 585,690 690,780 780,1025
be interacting with the database,

292
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,980
0,335 335,560 560,695 695,830 830,980
even if if it's an

293
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,460
0,255 255,740
Excel spreadsheet.|

294
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,500
0,165 165,440
It bit.|

295
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,645
0,290 290,580 1980,2380 3180,3485 3485,3695
Is one, and this course

296
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,285
0,255 255,605 625,1025 2185,2475 2475,2640
is important because because you're

297
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:21,975
0,45 45,105 105,180 180,375 375,690
going to end up interacting

298
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,220
0,105 105,315 315,665 895,1140 1140,1245
with database systems, you need

299
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,525
0,165 165,345 345,525 525,740 1000,1305
to understand what's actually get

300
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:25,380
0,305
inside.|

301
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,655
0,260 260,425 425,635 635,800 800,965
Even if, if, if it's

302
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,825
0,135 135,455 505,825 825,1020 1020,1170
a small application like running

303
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:28,965
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,695 805,1140
in your cell phone or

304
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,250
0,335 745,1080 1080,1935 1935,2025 2025,2285
a application withabytes of data,

305
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,990
0,410 410,620 620,830 830,1150 1860,2330
it's important to understand queries.

306
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,540
0,135 135,225 225,435 435,800 1150,1550
Or when you database system,

307
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,280
0,275 275,410 410,620 620,970
what does it actually?|

308
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
0,320 320,575 575,785 785,950 950,1280
And what are the tradeoffs

309
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,130
0,75 75,195 195,405 405,630 630,810
you would make for how

310
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,075
0,165 165,345 345,525 525,720 720,945
you use one data model

311
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,650
0,270 270,635 715,1005 1005,1245 1245,1575
versus another, or one database

312
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,520
0,300 300,620 790,1190
approach versus another?|

313
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,815
0,320 320,395 395,530 530,815 815,1115
What's the most widely deployed

314
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:47,655
0,180 180,405 405,525 525,600 600,840
database system in the world?

315
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,380
0,225 225,300 300,390 390,480 480,725
Can I take a guess?|

316
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,695
0,230 230,305 305,410 410,560 560,725
Everyone has a cell phone,

317
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:53,720
0,275
right?|

318
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,905
0,425 425,605 605,755 755,860 860,1025
Sql light is on every

319
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,080
0,225 225,695 1675,1920 1920,2055 2055,2175
single cellphone and it's written

320
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,685
0,225 225,450 450,740 1210,1485 1485,1605
by one dude down in

321
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,240
0,135 135,425 1255,1655 2035,2295 2295,2555
north Carolina. Kind, but like

322
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,315
0,395 395,590 590,695 695,845 845,1055
helper doesn't have an address.

323
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:02,945
0,195 195,255 255,390 390,570 570,630
He's like, ah, he's like

324
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,120
0,105 105,485
a nomad.|

325
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,385
0,245 245,455 455,590 590,770 770,875
So let's an example of

326
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,285
0,60 60,285 285,540 540,675 675,900
a database. We talk to

327
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,720
0,365 1435,1770 1770,1995 1995,2160 2160,2435
university application. We talk about

328
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,950
0,305 305,485 485,680 680,905 905,1070
something more relevant to everyone

329
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,520
0,260 1270,1545 1545,1710 1710,1920 1920,2570
here. Same thing like Spotify

330
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,940
0,245 245,365 365,590 590,935 935,1250
or like band camp or

331
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,500
0,525 525,645 645,920 1540,1940
itunes or keep music.|

332
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,310
0,230 230,305 305,455 455,620 620,800
So we can create a

333
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,040
0,300 300,630 630,980 1150,1440 1440,1730
really simple database that has

334
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,970
0,400 420,680 680,1180 1440,1990 3300,3700
basically two entities. There's artists

335
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,560
0,275 275,395 395,820
appear on albums.|

336
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,280
0,210 210,360 360,495 495,615 615,720
So the thing we need

337
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,880
0,135 135,255 255,330 330,420 420,600
to store in our data

338
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,975
0,195 195,315 315,420 420,680 850,1095
is gonna be like for

339
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,565
0,195 195,435 435,725 1075,1350 1350,1590
every single artist, yeah, what's

340
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,830
0,120 120,390 390,675 675,915 915,1265
their name? What country did

341
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,015
0,320 320,640 1050,1310 1310,1430 1430,1625
they start? And the album

342
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:34,720
0,165 165,270 270,405 405,600 600,705
could be like, what's the

343
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,695
0,165 165,315 315,420 420,680 700,975
name of the album, when

344
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,850
0,120 120,225 225,330 330,575 865,1155
did it come out, what

345
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,400
0,290 310,570 570,690 690,950
artists appear on it?|

346
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,980
0,290 290,580
And so.|

347
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,200
0,275 275,440 440,590 590,740 740,1030
What we talk about now

348
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,605
0,365 365,605 605,860 860,1085 1085,1265
we do a sort of

349
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:44,880
0,270 270,555 555,905 925,1170 1170,1275
straw man implementation of a

350
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,860
0,260
database.|

351
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,975
0,400 1110,1355 1355,1520 1520,1685 1685,1865
Database and we'll see why

352
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,235
0,270 270,540 540,750 750,995 1015,1260
it's stupid and we see

353
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:49,940
0,105 105,240 240,420 420,570 570,705
all the problems that it's

354
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,425
0,60 60,150 150,410 1030,1290 1290,1485
going to have. And then

355
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:52,850
0,270 270,525 525,840 840,990 990,1425
that again that'll help motivate

356
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,600
0,225 225,420 420,570 570,660 660,750
why we actually want to

357
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,640
0,150 150,315 315,495 495,780 780,1040
build a full fledged database.

358
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,670
0,335 335,575 575,710 710,800 800,950
I rely on a full

359
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,900
0,240 240,500
fledged database.|

360
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,440
0,260 260,365 365,635 635,770 770,920
So the easiest way to

361
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,745
0,210 210,390 390,650 790,1125 1125,1305
implement a database system that

362
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,710
0,315 315,635 1075,1475 1555,1815 1815,1965
manages data is to just

363
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,200
0,210 210,530 1150,1440 1440,1940
use files on disk.|

364
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,940
0,380 380,650 650,785 785,980 980,1330
Right. So for every single,

365
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,465
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,845 845,995
for my two entities, I

366
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:09,140
0,90 90,195 195,405 405,600 600,675
have an album, I have

367
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,460
0,75 75,320 730,1005 1005,1125 1125,1320
an artist, I have a

368
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,990
0,465 465,705 705,1050 1050,1245 1245,1530
csv file, comma separated value

369
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,040
0,350
file.|

370
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,375
0,240 240,420 420,740 940,1185 1185,1335
And every single in that

371
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,480
0,305
file.|

372
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,180
0,305 305,515 515,725 725,1030
Tax every single line.|

373
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,340
0,400
Right.|

374
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,200
0,360 360,675 675,1010 1390,1790
I want to find.|

375
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,900
0,320 320,640
In my.|

376
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,815
0,320 320,380 380,500 500,635 635,725
I'm going to open it

377
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,190
0,245 895,1140 1140,1385 1795,2130 2130,2375
up, you know, parse it,

378
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,415
0,275 275,440 440,635 635,800 800,905
line my line and try

379
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:31,375
0,120 120,270 270,405 405,665 715,960
to find the data that

380
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,420
0,150 150,285 285,605
I'm looking for.|

381
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,780
0,400
Right.|

382
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,525
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,560 560,605
So say I want to

383
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:35,940
0,60 60,305
do something.|

384
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
0,365 365,590 590,1090 1380,1730 1730,2000
Versus the csv magic word

385
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,805
0,270 270,620 1450,1850 1990,2355 2355,2445
parts. Basically just splitting on

386
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,540
0,245 475,1025
the commas.|

387
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,545
0,260 260,350 350,470 470,710 710,935
Then if I find that

388
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,430
0,275 1255,1655 2065,2415 2415,2625 2625,2885
the the name of the.|

389
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,690
0,225 225,360 360,495 495,585 585,830
Then I print it out.|

390
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,340
0,400
Right.|

391
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,160
0,275 275,550
It works.|

392
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,640
0,245 245,305 305,395 395,670 990,1390
But this is bad. Why?|

393
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,220
0,320 320,545 545,740 740,905 905,1130
Yes, it can become really

394
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,015
0,240 240,390 390,495 495,630 630,795
slow as the number of

395
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:13,200
0,135
rows.|

396
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,000
0,275 275,515 515,680 680,860 860,1100
Says it's gone. Really, really

397
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,085
0,350 850,1250 1390,1695 1695,1905 1905,2085
slow increases. Yeah, so always

398
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,585
0,135 135,345 345,645 645,855 855,1500
to think of in extremes

399
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,040
0,300 300,665 835,1235
in, in software.|

400
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,795
0,290 290,530 530,880 1020,1400 1400,1655
Three records here. Yeah, I

401
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:23,410
0,135 135,285 285,420 420,525 525,615
can load that up in

402
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,265
0,90 90,255 255,495 495,690 690,855
a single page and parse

403
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,435
0,120 120,285 285,575 835,1080 1080,1170
that pretty quickly. But if

404
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:26,730
0,120 120,345 345,630 630,930 930,1295
I have 3 billion records.|

405
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,930
0,275 275,470 470,650 650,800 800,980
Then yeah, and if jizz

406
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,880
0,150 150,300 300,495 495,690 690,950
is the last, the last

407
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,120
0,320 320,485 485,590 590,755 755,1040
entry, then I gotta parse

408
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,100
0,165 165,375 375,570 570,720 720,980
every single line by line.|

409
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,240
0,400
Yes.|

410
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
0,610 630,1175 1175,1325 1325,1505 1505,1760
Insert deletion would be really

411
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,380
0,270
hard.|

412
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,560
0,400 630,1030 1200,1780
Consider system restrictions.|

413
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,940
0,260 260,425 425,590 590,740 740,1190
She says that the insertion

414
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,795
0,315 315,390 390,465 465,600 600,855
deletion would be really horrible

415
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:47,990
0,345 345,675 675,990 990,1475 1795,2195
given the system restrictions. So

416
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,100
0,665 665,830 830,920 920,1070 1070,1310
insertion wouldn't be that bad,

417
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,745
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,555 555,645
right? Because if I just

418
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,375
0,255 255,360 360,435 435,525 525,630
append to the end of

419
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,200
0,105 105,210 210,605 775,1175
it, who cares, right?|

420
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,195
0,290 290,455 455,605 605,815 815,995
Right. So she said, what

421
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:02,260
0,90 90,300 300,555 555,765 765,1065
if I keep things sorted

422
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,560
0,165 165,375 375,680
by release year?|

423
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,700
0,240 240,555 555,795 795,990 990,1140
Then, yeah, I have to

424
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,215
0,260 700,1035 1035,1230 1230,1365 1365,1515
go find where it should

425
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:07,120
0,275
be.|

426
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,255
0,275 275,410 410,670 1920,2240 2240,2405
That would suck. You also

427
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,240
0,210 210,575 985,1305 1305,1605 1605,1985
said update or delete, right?

428
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,135
0,245 245,350 350,455 455,560 560,755
If I want to delete

429
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:13,765
0,210 210,345 345,435 435,570 570,630
entry I get it's the

430
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:14,515
0,135 135,285 285,405 405,585 585,750
same problem as looking for

431
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:14,995
0,60 60,135 135,225 225,330 330,480
and I got to find

432
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:15,610
0,120 120,210 210,375 375,495 495,615
the thing I'm looking for

433
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,640
0,105 105,240 240,500
and delete it.|

434
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,055
0,275 275,550 810,1210 2370,2630 2630,2705
Those are issues, but there

435
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:20,805
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,555 555,750
are some other problems as

436
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:21,720
0,275
well.|

437
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,460
0,290 290,580 660,1040 1040,1420 1500,1880
Record one that is a

438
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,800
0,360 360,630 630,920
stream if there.|

439
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,310
0,300 300,620 640,1035 1035,1395 1395,1670
In that, then it'll turn.|

440
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,905
0,335 335,545 545,710 710,860 860,995
So your statement is that

441
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,375
0,225 225,720 720,870 870,1115 1135,1470
I'm representing everything as, say,

442
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,395
0,365 385,645 645,750 750,855 855,1020
strings, and then if there's

443
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,620
0,75 75,335
a what.|

444
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,940
0,260 260,520 720,1100 1100,1840
We are in 1990.|

445
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,285
0,365 365,730 870,1445 1445,1715 1715,2015
So if accidentally, somebody would

446
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,040
0,305
start.|

447
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,150
0,305 305,500 500,680 680,830 830,980
Yeah, correct. Yeah, so her

448
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,220
0,195 195,500 880,1400
comment is I'm.|

449
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,805
0,400 780,1115 1115,1190 1190,1265 1265,1355
Uh, I'm so in the

450
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:54,900
0,245 415,660 660,780 780,930 930,1095
years in this case is

451
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,030
0,210 210,435 435,570 570,690 690,1130
text file, so it's ascii

452
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,275
0,400 750,1010 1010,1220 1220,1550 1550,1895
text, but my magic parse

453
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,240
0,195 195,360 360,450 450,660 660,965
function, which I haven't defined,

454
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,975
0,290 290,560 560,920 920,1265 1265,1535
is somehow knowing, oh, this

455
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,790
0,210 210,515 685,945 945,1445 1555,1815
should be an integer and

456
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,825
0,150 150,225 225,330 330,590 730,1035
it's going to call a

457
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,535
0,135 135,365 1225,1530 1530,1590 1590,1710
to I, it's going to

458
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,100
0,210 210,545 565,855 855,1290 1290,1565
cast the, the VR into

459
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,780
0,305 305,530 530,695 695,800 800,1300
the string to an integer.|

460
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,320
0,350 350,700 840,1085 1085,1330
And it the best.|

461
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:12,760
0,60 60,105 105,240 240,405 405,525
If it's just a bunch

462
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
0,120 120,285 285,465 465,740
of files on deck.|

463
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,960
0,260 260,515 515,760 1230,1660
A parsing error? Corrupt.|

464
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,180
0,60 60,120 120,195 195,440
That's a good one.|

465
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,660
0,230 230,290 290,350 350,455 455,730
What are some other problems?|

466
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,560
0,330 330,495 495,750 750,945 945,1080
3D and writing to the

467
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,880
0,225 225,540 540,920
file, it slow.|

468
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,060
0,245 245,380 380,590 590,815 815,950
You say reading, writing the

469
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,200
0,230 520,795 795,915 915,1005 1005,1140
file, we sort of covered

470
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,500
0,180 180,470
that, right?|

471
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,985
0,75 75,120 120,435 435,540 540,675
If you're inserting the end,

472
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,340
0,165 165,300 300,575
no big deal.|

473
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,800
0,400
Reading.|

474
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,110
0,245 245,365 365,515 515,790 900,1300
Could it could me well.|

475
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,055
0,260 260,520 690,965 965,1145 1145,1295
We said a comment in

476
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,650
0,90 90,255 255,480 480,785 1195,1595
the name might break the

477
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,680
0,320 320,650 650,1040 1040,1330 2100,2500
like python packages for that.|

478
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,320
0,400
Yes.|

479
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,075
0,335 335,545 545,695 800,860 860,965
Yeah, you said you're not

480
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:52,705
0,105 105,165 165,285 285,465 465,630
allowed to have current use

481
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,580
0,120 120,225 225,485
of the file.|

482
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,195
0,275 275,470 470,650 650,800 800,935
The writer as things get

483
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,960
0,60 60,135 135,665 715,1115
a little dicey, yeah.|

484
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,500
0,380 380,635 635,860 860,1115 1115,1310
Showing the fact that the

485
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,960
0,290 790,1190
zero is.|

486
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,980
0,400
Yeah.|

487
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,580
0,260 260,520
But it.|

488
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,855
0,275 275,515 515,785 785,1040 1040,1265
Of the the file, the

489
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,565
0,135 135,255 255,515 835,1415 1435,1710
scheme of the correlation of

490
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,120
0,135 135,395 865,1170 1170,1895
the database is implicitly.|

491
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,020
0,400 1260,1505 1505,1625 1625,1900
That in the second.|

492
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,720
0,260 260,380 380,640 930,1330
So we covered, right?|

493
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,680
0,260 260,365 365,560 560,905 905,1300
So how to ensure that?|

494
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,560
0,305 305,500 500,665 665,940
Going back real quickly.|

495
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,420
0,380 380,605 605,695 695,815 815,1120
Right. So I have. Woo.|

496
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,310
0,120 120,315 315,435 435,645 645,950
But I'm gonna fix it.

497
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,220
0,260 260,350 350,410 410,560 560,770
I got to make sure

498
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,330
0,135 135,345 345,630 630,855 855,1110
that every single place where

499
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,820
0,210 210,470
I have.|

500
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
0,400 540,785 785,935 935,1175 1175,1400
So it all gets updated

501
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,060
0,165 165,440 1450,1850 2050,2340 2340,2780
the same these on disk,

502
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,690
0,305 305,485 485,760 780,1025 1025,1130
the operating system or the

503
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,120
0,270 270,600 600,860
foss doesn't know.|

504
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,430
0,245 245,380 380,605 605,940 1080,1340
It just knows that, you

505
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,855
0,260 940,1185 1185,1275 1275,1350 1350,1425
know, whatever you want to

506
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:17,760
0,245
read.|

507
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,395
0,400 480,770 770,905 905,995 995,1175
So we now in the

508
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,060
0,335 505,750 750,995
application to go.|

509
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,740
0,365 365,605 605,880
We make sure.|

510
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,150
0,135 135,210 210,620 940,1185 1185,1410
All the entries will we

511
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,500
0,380
actions.|

512
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,435
0,275 275,410 410,560 560,725 725,935
She brought up the issue

513
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,095
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,495 495,660
of what if someone ever

514
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:28,815
0,195 195,375 375,495 495,600 600,720
writes a year with them,

515
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:30,210
0,255 255,635 895,1215 1215,1290 1290,1395
valid string. We'd throw a

516
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,190
0,300 300,560 1120,1395 1395,1635 1635,1980
parsing error in my example

517
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,825
0,380 550,825 825,1035 1035,1335 1335,1635
here. I only have, I'm

518
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,760
0,180 180,375 375,480 480,645 645,935
assuming there's a one one

519
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,480
0,760 840,1240
correspondence between.|

520
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,000
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,620 620,880
Could only have one artist

521
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,600
0,290 290,455 455,590 590,740 740,950
but obviously we know that's

522
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,620
0,230 400,645 645,810 810,960 960,1020
not the case and a

523
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,920
0,90 90,180 180,590
lot of albums.|

524
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,580
0,165 165,285 285,360 360,465 465,660
So how do I go

525
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,070
0,225 225,435 435,720 720,1095 1095,1490
change my files now to

526
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,360
0,290 290,425 425,670
account for that?|

527
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,850
0,320 320,640 930,1175 1175,1295 1295,1780
Lead artist who has albums.|

528
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,365
0,400 480,880 960,1250 1250,1460 1460,1685
Right. Well, in my example

529
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:56,700
0,305 385,720 720,915 915,1125 1125,1335
here, nothing will happen. And

530
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,240
0,150 150,285 285,375 375,450 450,540
now I got a bunch

531
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,800
0,165 165,630 630,950 1210,1455 1455,1560
of albums that have an

532
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,520
0,285 285,405 405,525 525,615 615,720
artist's name that has a

533
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,720
0,135 135,360 360,710
map ending to.|

534
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,045
0,365 365,730 900,1300 1830,2225 2225,2345
So the reference integrity gets

535
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,060
0,275
broken.|

536
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,675
0,260 260,410 410,545 545,635 635,785
We brought a lot of

537
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,115
0,300 300,695 715,1095 1095,1335 1335,1440
implementation issues already, like how

538
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:09,020
0,60 60,135 135,395
do you find?|

539
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,710
0,245 245,410 410,680 680,980 980,1400
In my example here, it's

540
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,785
0,255 255,390 390,680 1090,2060 2800,3075
it's O N right, I

541
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:14,610
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,660 660,825
have to do a brute

542
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,290
0,260 460,1170 1170,1350 1350,1545 1545,1680
force scanot scan across the

543
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,130
0,165 165,390 390,555 555,690 690,840
entire file to find the

544
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,440
0,105 105,240 240,375 375,680
thing I'm looking for.|

545
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,870
0,400 1260,1505 1505,1715 1715,2030 2030,2270
Now if I assume that

546
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,080
0,440
there.|

547
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,625
0,400 420,770 770,1100 1100,1385 1385,1535
Only one person that you

548
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,585
0,105 105,285 285,465 465,720 720,960
know only went out with

549
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,890
0,90 90,255 255,575 925,1185 1185,1305
a given name. Then I

550
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,110
0,255 255,615 615,810 810,975 975,1220
can stop because I'm done.|

551
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,430
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,755 755,860
The same name all the

552
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,380
0,260
time.|

553
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,820
0,465 465,770
Albums that.|

554
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,885
0,60 60,120 120,285 285,630 630,765
I don't know jizo puts

555
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,900
0,275
out.|

556
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,010
0,290 290,470 470,605 605,890 890,1010
Like boot lake jiza in

557
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,900
0,210 210,375 375,495 495,630 630,890
Florida or something like that.

558
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,855
0,260 260,350 350,440 440,605 605,875
I got to keep scanning

559
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,160
0,105 105,285 285,605
the entire file.|

560
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,250
0,90 90,165 165,240 240,300 300,390
And that's going to be

561
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,400
0,260 760,1050 1050,1170 1170,1400
n order of n.|

562
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,030
0,320 320,560 560,830 830,1070 1070,1250
My example here, again, I

563
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,550
0,290 1390,1875 1875,2250 2250,2415 2415,2520
have that's, that's operating in

564
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,245
0,90 90,350 1150,1410 1410,1605 1605,1695
the files, but let's say

565
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:48,920
0,105 105,195 195,255 255,510 510,675
I want to rewrite it

566
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,375
0,135 135,345 345,710 1090,1350 1350,1455
to now run. I want

567
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,035
0,120 120,240 240,405 405,570 570,660
to want to write a

568
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:51,890
0,195 195,450 450,600 600,720 720,855
new application that uses the

569
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,595
0,150 150,375 375,555 555,630 630,705
same database, but I want

570
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,230
0,90 90,180 180,255 255,360 360,635
to write it in rust

571
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,730
0,245 245,425 425,515 515,650 650,940
because that's the hot thing.|

572
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,955
0,195 195,315 315,495 495,540 540,615
So now I've got to

573
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,610
0,135 135,330 330,540 540,845 1255,1655
go make sure that whatever

574
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,315
0,320 320,500 500,905 905,1055 1055,1205
information or implicit scheme I

575
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,370
0,165 165,300 300,435 435,765 765,1055
had in my python code

576
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,970
0,320 320,530 530,755 755,1090 1110,1400
now maps over to my

577
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,230
0,210 210,530 820,1065 1065,1155 1155,1260
rust code. But then now

578
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,325
0,105 105,255 255,560 610,915 915,1095
if my files change, I've

579
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:04,760
0,30 30,75 75,195 195,330 330,435
got to make sure I

580
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
0,165 165,470 700,990 990,1140 1140,1440
go change both the python

581
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,030
0,150 150,255 255,345 345,510 510,830
code and the rust code.|

582
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,590
0,290 290,425 425,530 530,755 755,980
Maybe, say the guy, the

583
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,330
0,285 285,560 880,1125 1125,1370 1480,1740
python code, you know, is

584
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,370
0,135 135,410 850,1250 1450,1725 1725,2040
in jail and we can't

585
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,540
0,195 195,470
update it.|

586
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,140
0,400 450,850 900,1145 1145,1220 1220,1310
Right now, what do I

587
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,520
0,260
do?|

588
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,040
0,230 230,305 305,550
Going to break.|

589
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,640
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,730
What if the APP?|

590
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,920
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,740 740,1070
Even on the same machine

591
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,865
0,240 240,405 405,705 705,825 825,945
where my python code is

592
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,125
0,275 415,885 885,1020 1020,1155 1155,1260
running rights running like a

593
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,070
0,525 525,615 615,720 720,840 840,945
microservice on a on a

594
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,360
0,165 165,470 850,1095 1095,1185 1185,1290
separate box, how do I

595
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,610
0,240 240,555 555,765 765,945 945,1250
get access to that other?

596
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,910
0,245 245,320 320,410 410,590 590,770
How do I get access

597
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,280
0,75 75,195 195,500
to that file?|

598
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,480
0,260 260,520
And then?|

599
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,700
0,260 260,440 440,620 620,755 755,1030
What happens if you have?|

600
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,205
0,290 290,545 545,665 665,785 785,935
Two threads trying to write

601
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:36,970
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,585 585,765
to the same file, the

602
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,760
0,260
same.|

603
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,535
0,365 365,590 590,815 815,1055 1055,1175
Well, you can rely on

604
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,590
0,150 150,345 345,570 570,780 780,1055
the operating system to do.|

605
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,150
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,605 605,680
But again, if I have

606
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,170
0,120 120,360 360,705 705,930 930,1020
a billion records and I

607
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,845
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,555 555,675
want to update one of

608
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:45,460
0,120 120,300 300,360 360,465 465,615
them, don't want to lock

609
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,155
0,150 150,410 940,1230 1230,1470 1470,1695
a billion billion records, just

610
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,220
0,120 120,210 210,315 315,575
do that one up.|

611
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,435
0,605 605,695 695,830 830,1025 1025,1205
Ideally when I fill more

612
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:50,670
0,195 195,515 565,825 825,960 960,1235
fine grain that can have

613
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,440
0,380 380,880
multiple threads.|

614
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,120
0,400 540,815 815,1090 1680,2080
Not anybody really was.|

615
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,765
0,195 195,270 270,390 390,540 540,645
How to make sure that

616
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:00,115
0,120 120,270 270,435 435,725 1105,1350
our data is safe if

617
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,500
0,75 75,180 180,440
there's a crash?|

618
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,320
0,400
Right.|

619
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,000
0,395 395,790 900,1300 1980,2315 2315,2540
And then I crash before

620
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
0,150 150,315 315,710
I F sync.|

621
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,430
0,260 260,365 365,485 485,725 725,950
Some of that data actually

622
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,560
0,120 120,225 225,345 345,630 630,1130
might have gotten thata disk.

623
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,220
0,245 245,350 350,610 1170,1570
So when my, my.|

624
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,500
0,275 275,550 900,1300
I must twice.|

625
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,450
0,260 260,485 485,710 710,815 815,920
Which is not what I

626
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,215
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,645 705,765
want, right? Because now I've

627
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:21,440
0,300 300,545
corrupted data.|

628
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,330
0,365 365,590 590,725 725,1000 1170,1570
Or now my database is

629
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,645
0,290 290,515 515,815 815,1040 1040,1145
is really big and I

630
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:26,455
0,245 295,540 540,630 630,705 705,810
have a lot of people

631
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:27,775
0,120 120,285 285,480 480,755 1075,1320
want to access it. How

632
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:28,680
0,75 75,165 165,345 345,585 585,905
do I make sure that

633
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,685
0,275 275,550 600,1100 1100,1205 1205,1565
I can duplicate and replicate

634
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,185
0,165 165,435 435,815 1165,1410 1410,1500
across multiple machines so they

635
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,370
0,90 90,285 285,600 600,1050 1050,1185
can all service reads at

636
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,140
0,120 120,380
the same?|

637
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,415
0,245 245,470 470,785 785,1025 1025,1205
So my application can scale

638
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:36,240
0,275
up.|

639
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,705
0,245 245,335 335,410 410,470 470,545
Files aren't going to do

640
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:38,740
0,120 120,240 240,485
that for me.|

641
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,775
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,695 695,995
So this is just a

642
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,580
0,315 315,795 795,1055
quick smattering of.|

643
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,620
0,275 275,470 470,790
Is management system.|

644
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,955
0,320 610,900 900,1065 1065,1200 1200,1335
Right. And why of course

645
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,040
0,150 150,420 420,675 675,810 810,1085
like this, in my opinion.|

646
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,135
0,320 320,500 500,760 900,1300 1380,1745
So as our agent, management

647
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:50,960
0,330 330,570 570,675 675,735 735,825
system is going to be

648
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,550
0,225 225,590 850,1200 1200,1425 1425,1590
the the software that can

649
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,830
0,290 1060,1460 1540,1890 1890,2130 2130,2280
allow applications to store and

650
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,170
0,410 460,795 795,975 975,1080 1080,1340
analyze information in a database.|

651
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,740
0,365 365,1115 1115,1385 1385,1580 1580,1700
And ideally not have to

652
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,970
0,180 180,480 480,795 795,990 990,1230
worry about all the things

653
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,220
0,375 375,615 615,720 720,915 915,1250
that we just talked about.

654
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,685
0,350 350,485 485,650 650,770 770,905
That's not always been the

655
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,080
0,275 445,780 780,930 930,1110 1110,1395
case. There's many trade offs

656
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,200
0,290 1150,1550
to the.|

657
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,245
0,245 245,490 660,1190 1190,1415 1415,1655
You know, guarantees in exchange

658
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,680
0,225 225,545
for performance.|

659
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,480
0,350 350,560 560,725 725,950 950,1270
And a general purpose system

660
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,700
0,400 1170,1445 1445,1580 1580,1790 1790,2140
typically allow you to adjust,

661
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,270
0,245 245,365 365,530 530,725 725,1130
you know, what those tradeoffs

662
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,280
0,180 180,440
actually are.|

663
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,380
0,275 275,500 500,850
And so a.|

664
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,300
0,285 285,585 585,980 1240,1635 1635,1920
The, the data system is

665
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,780
0,135 135,380 820,1220 1600,1920 1920,2480
going to define or specify

666
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,790
0,500 500,730 1470,1790 1790,1970 1970,2090
inherentit and how you can

667
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,990
0,180 180,390 390,930 930,1095 1095,1200
go create databases, how you

668
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,355
0,105 105,330 330,650 850,1170 1170,1365
can query them, how you

669
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,305
0,275 565,965 1135,1380 1380,1515 1515,1950
can changes, you can administer

670
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:36,745
0,120 120,675 675,930 930,1200 1200,1440
the databases, making, making speech

671
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,140
0,195 195,330 330,465 465,755
changes and other things.|

672
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,600
0,425 425,530 530,1180 1320,1700 1700,1970
Insert a correspondence of some

673
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,240
0,120 120,255 255,495 495,830
kind of data model.|

674
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,485
0,215 215,290 290,470 470,695 695,875
Well, I say also too

675
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,880
0,150 150,300 300,525 525,875 1165,1395
that this is again you

676
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,630
0,75 75,225 225,450 450,645 645,750
no matter whether you go

677
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,515
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,660 660,885
off and actually build database

678
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,480
0,335 1345,1560 1560,1650 1650,1830 1830,1965
systems, you know in in

679
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,190
0,90 90,225 225,330 330,435 435,710
your day to day job,

680
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,505
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,545 545,785
this is to be, its

681
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:51,330
0,255 255,420 420,495 495,645 645,825
important again to know where

682
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,395
0,120 120,330 330,615 615,855 855,1065
you go because at some

683
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,235
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,600 600,840
point you're gonna be some

684
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:54,180
0,210 210,435 435,705 705,855 855,945
build some application. You have

685
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,890
0,225 225,590 790,1065 1065,1290 1290,1710
to decide what database managementception

686
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,195
0,150 150,255 255,360 360,620 1060,1305
I want to use and

687
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:57,855
0,120 120,255 255,375 375,525 525,660
that should always be sort

688
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:58,995
0,105 105,285 285,605 745,1005 1005,1140
the first choice that like

689
00:20:58,995 --> 00:20:59,955
0,150 150,390 390,480 480,705 705,960
you don't want to do

690
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:00,600
0,275
my.|

691
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,840
0,275 275,550
But here.|

692
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,980
0,230 230,320 320,425 425,670
A lot of problems.|

693
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,060
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,530 530,650
I was like, do you

694
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,765
0,135 135,255 255,390 390,540 540,705
think you like at a

695
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:08,720
0,455
startup?|

696
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,830
0,400 450,785 785,875 875,980 980,1100
And you're trying to build

697
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,960
0,225 225,495 495,800 970,1370
an application, a application.|

698
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,040
0,320 320,470 470,530 530,590 590,680
Startup doesn't have a lot

699
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,375
0,105 105,315 315,615 615,950 1000,1335
of money your your your

700
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,230
0,270 270,375 375,555 555,735 735,855
stressed or time to try

701
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,935
0,150 150,315 315,450 450,585 585,705
to get things out the

702
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:17,670
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,600 600,735
door to get the first

703
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,840
0,180 180,330 330,435 435,680 940,1170
version out the door. Do

704
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,335
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,405 405,495
you really want to be

705
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:20,475
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,915 915,1140
spending your time making sure

706
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:21,345
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,675 675,870
that your data is safe

707
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,100
0,135 135,285 285,360 360,480 480,755
and there's is a crash?|

708
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,450
0,245 245,350 350,455 455,605 605,890
Because in the end, that's

709
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,815
0,135 135,330 330,750 750,1005 1005,1365
not a distinguishing feature of

710
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,080
0,270 270,510 510,720 720,915 915,1265
your business or your application.

711
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,310
0,365 365,770 770,875 875,965 965,1210
Nobody cares that if you

712
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,690
0,260 260,410 410,700 870,1115 1115,1360
actually lose data that you

713
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,750
0,320 320,500 500,635 635,815 815,980
so if you crash, you

714
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,220
0,225 225,360 360,650 850,1230 1230,1470
don't lose data that's considered

715
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,160
0,350
like.|

716
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,040
0,105 105,350
You know.|

717
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,855
0,290 290,530 530,875 875,1270 1740,2105
This point in in modern

718
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:38,655
0,315 315,575 1105,1365 1365,1515 1515,1800
computing systems and so rather

719
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:40,050
0,395 685,960 960,1080 1080,1200 1200,1395
than spending all this time

720
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,875
0,165 165,255 255,465 465,675 675,825
trying to rent your own

721
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,720
0,390 390,660 660,1025 1525,1770 1770,1845
bespoke database system, you should

722
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
0,105 105,270 270,450 450,740
just use something up.|

723
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,190
0,335 335,530 530,665 665,940 1110,1510
Chances are, it po us

724
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,640
0,400
and.|

725
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,870
0,150 150,210 210,270 270,500 790,1230
Out of a hundred that

726
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,695
0,300 300,375 375,495 495,660 660,825
that's the first choice you

727
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:52,650
0,135 135,395 955,1335 1335,1650 1650,1955
should use, maybe steep light.|

728
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,395
0,275 275,440 440,605 605,725 725,845
But post cuts will get

729
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:58,160
0,210 210,545 1255,1655
you pretty far.|

730
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:00,590
0,60 60,165 165,330 330,480 480,755
That I'm talking about here.|

731
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,250
0,400 750,1025 1025,1175 1175,1400 1400,1640
So again, a data model

732
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,270
0,135 135,225 225,315 315,560 700,1020
is going to be, again,

733
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,950
0,195 195,360 360,405 405,450 450,680
how we're going to represent

734
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,120
0,400
a.|

735
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,860
0,710 760,1125 1125,1365 1365,1560 1560,1740
Entities or the collection of

736
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,840
0,260 340,600 600,735 735,1010
data in our database.|

737
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,680
0,400
So.|

738
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,390
0,400 1470,1745 1745,1955 1955,2255 2255,2480
So the data model is

739
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,540
0,165 165,390 390,710 760,1400
this high level abstraction.|

740
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,145
0,545 545,785 785,980 980,1270 1710,2045
Specifies how we represent individual

741
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,310
0,605 865,1265 1315,1650 1650,1875 1875,2165
entities and potentially that relate

742
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,440
0,400
to.|

743
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,500
0,275 275,395 395,545 545,665 665,830
And again, we're trying to

744
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,565
0,270 270,615 615,840 840,960 960,1065
model some aspect of the

745
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,830
0,135 135,390 390,705 705,960 960,1265
real world. Students take classes,

746
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,925
0,290 290,580 600,920 920,1270 1770,2045
students are get grades. They're

747
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,820
0,165 165,515 655,990 990,1325
in their home department.|

748
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,460
0,260 260,395 395,650 650,1160 1160,1370
And then the schema is

749
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,870
0,135 135,210 210,440 640,1040 1120,1410
going to represent the, the

750
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,345
0,290 670,930 930,1155 1155,1520 2080,2475
definition or the description of

751
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:41,540
0,395
the.|

752
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,715
0,300 300,680 880,1185 1185,1820 1840,2175
Of what those entities in

753
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,710
0,335 655,975 975,1295 1615,1875 1875,1995
our data model of our

754
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,140
0,255 255,540 540,830
database look like.|

755
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,455
0,400 480,875 875,1175 1175,1430 1430,1685
Student names you have have

756
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,895
0,210 210,465 465,815 865,1140 1140,1440
birth dates, have email addresses

757
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:52,290
0,135 135,270 270,545 985,1230 1230,1395
and so forth. You would

758
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,700
0,405 405,570 570,735 735,1010 1030,1410
specify all of those in

759
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,170
0,315 315,800 910,1155 1155,1260 1260,1470
our schema, and then we,

760
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,880
0,180 180,345 345,890 970,1590 1590,1710
we would instantiate instances of

761
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,470
0,105 105,350 1030,1335 1335,1485 1485,1590
a database based on a

762
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,020
0,165 165,450 450,765 765,1100 1150,1550
data model according to the

763
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,060
0,520
schema.|

764
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,470
0,245 245,440 440,515 515,635 635,740
So there's a bunch of

765
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,460
0,230 280,570 570,780 780,930 930,990
different data models that are

766
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,540
0,105 105,380 490,735 735,855 855,1080
out there. So this goes,

767
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,455
0,270 270,495 495,705 705,840 840,915
this goes back to the

768
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:08,000
0,195 195,480 480,720 720,1290 1290,1545
very beginning of databases. People

769
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,110
0,180 180,410 550,825 825,975 975,1110
sort of realize, oh, we

770
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,000
0,105 105,350 1030,1305 1305,1545 1545,1890
need a is in, is

771
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
0,240 240,375 375,650
in a database.|

772
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,560
0,400 870,1270 1620,2020 2040,2440
So most systems today?|

773
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,975
0,305 305,485 485,635 635,815 815,995
Something that looks like like

774
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,000
0,105 105,345 345,965 1225,1680 1680,2025
the relational databases, relational relational

775
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,190
0,225 225,530 1270,1680 1680,1890 1890,2190
data model, there's things called

776
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,185
0,240 240,560 1120,1590 1590,1815 1815,1995
object relational postgres is it

777
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:24,845
0,120 120,285 285,420 420,510 510,660
just means you can have

778
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,500
0,270 270,540 540,845 985,1320 1320,1655
user defined types to extend

779
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,490
0,260 260,380 380,470 470,620 620,940
what your rel relations are.

780
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,445
0,230 230,320 320,425 425,910 1500,1865
But at a higho most

781
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,170
0,285 285,605 1195,1470 1470,1590 1590,1725
data systems are going be

782
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,760
0,380 760,1035 1035,1185 1185,1395 1395,1590
relational. I think there's that

783
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,250
0,330 330,590 640,900 900,1230 1230,1490
DB engines, the ranking that.|

784
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,530
0,245 245,395 395,620 620,940 1410,1670
The most popular datab I

785
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,175
0,135 135,300 300,450 450,555 555,645
think the four out of

786
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:40,540
0,135 135,420 420,690 690,885 885,1365
the five most popular databases

787
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,230
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,465 465,690
are going to be all

788
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,240
0,350 790,1365 1365,1605 1605,1785 1785,2010
relational mongo is, is the

789
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,120
0,350
fire.|

790
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,030
0,275 275,440 440,500 500,605 605,710
Then there's a bunch of

791
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,935
0,75 75,240 240,465 465,770 1600,1905
these other data models that

792
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:48,760
0,135 135,240 240,435 435,660 660,825
sort of fall under this

793
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,320
0,435 435,710
umbrella term.|

794
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,815
0,365 365,560 560,635 635,755 755,1025
A thing or no sql

795
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,090
0,240 240,510 510,705 705,1005 1005,1275
systems, it usually the document,

796
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,400
0,225 225,530 550,840 840,1340
data model or json.|

797
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,500
0,245 245,350 350,610 930,1565 1565,1820
One of these, cassandra, essentially

798
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,400
0,300 300,540 540,705 705,810 810,900
become, has become one of

799
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,335
0,230 700,1100 1390,1635 1635,1800 1800,1935
these, um, but there's key

800
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:04,125
0,225 225,575 1045,1805 2365,2625 2625,2790
value stores, databases, and then

801
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,805
0,305 835,1200 1200,1410 1410,1545 1545,1680
what family is this sort

802
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,180
0,120 120,695
of bestized?|

803
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,400
0,455 455,760 840,1400 1400,1580 1580,1790
There's array matrix and vector

804
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,960
0,290 310,600 600,890 1150,1425 1425,1560
data data models. These are

805
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,290
0,260 280,680 760,1160 1720,2025 2025,2330
primarily used for machine learning

806
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,390
0,290 290,580 1440,1840 2520,2780 2780,2900
or scientific applications. I think

807
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,245
0,105 105,180 180,300 300,705 705,855
of like a satellite going

808
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:33,770
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,435 435,525
around and taking a bunch

809
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,865
0,120 120,380 550,795 795,930 930,1095
of photos. You could store

810
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:37,700
0,210 210,390 390,540 540,845
that as an array.|

811
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,025
0,590 590,860 860,1400 1400,1690 1980,2225
Tensors to trainsat model, you

812
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,255
0,105 105,360 360,755 775,1035 1035,1230
would represent that as a

813
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,500
0,210 210,485 655,915 915,1035 1035,1245
as well. And so there's

814
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,020
0,390 390,710 850,1125 1125,1260 1260,1520
specialized database that can represent

815
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,700
0,470 470,730 960,1360
natively represent array.|

816
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,580
0,245 245,485 485,770 770,935 935,1070
And then these ones at

817
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,440
0,105 105,270 270,435 435,570 570,860
the end for old people,

818
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,250
0,260 260,485 485,725 725,950 950,1160
hier, toical network and multi

819
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,400
0,320
value.|

820
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,565
0,400 510,815 815,1010 1010,1475 1475,1595
These are considered obsolete at

821
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:57,700
0,135 135,425
this point.|

822
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,615
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,605 605,755
Because I still make a

823
00:24:58,615 --> 00:24:59,760
0,150 150,285 285,545 565,855 855,1145
lot of money use each.|

824
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,945
0,350 350,635 635,875 875,1040 1040,1205
The hi model is using

825
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,080
0,545
IMF.|

826
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,580
0,515 515,650 650,890 890,1160 1160,1340
IBM first database system that

827
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,960
0,150 150,440
they built.|

828
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
0,195 195,315 315,495 495,800 1060,1320
Of all the parts for

829
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
0,260 340,740
the economy.|

830
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,940
0,730
1960.|

831
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,335
0,320 320,640 720,1100 1100,1480 2040,2285
Every ATM basically uses, I

832
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:21,115
0,105 105,255 255,420 420,555 555,780
mean not, not the box

833
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:22,090
0,255 255,420 420,555 555,705 705,975
itself when when you communicate

834
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,020
0,225 225,470 640,1040
to the bank.|

835
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,725
0,195 195,270 270,360 360,540 540,705
All of these systems are

836
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,040
0,150 150,665
using ims.|

837
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,680
0,380 380,760
So pretty.|

838
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,850
0,320 400,645 645,765 765,975 975,1170
And the us government still

839
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,960
0,195 195,650
uses imax.|

840
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,280
0,320 320,560 560,770 770,950 950,1190
And so, so these things

841
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,540
0,350 430,690 690,825 825,1065 1065,1260
exist. But if you're brand

842
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,125
0,195 195,345 345,420 420,480 480,585
new, part of it you're

843
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:35,740
0,90 90,285 285,375 375,480 480,615
not, you're not gonna say

844
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,580
0,210 210,270 270,330 330,435 435,840
I'm going to use ims

845
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,270
0,150 150,285 285,480 480,570 570,690
or I'm, I'm gonna use

846
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,680
0,495 495,830
idms like.|

847
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:39,535
0,45 45,195 195,405 405,540 540,630
You'd be insane to do

848
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,300
0,245 355,630 630,905
that, but again.|

849
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,900
0,245 245,335 335,580
Not at all.|

850
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:43,790
0,60 60,165 165,300 300,510 510,845
It's not really relevant here,

851
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,820
0,290 290,425 425,590 590,910
right for this course.|

852
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,995
0,260 260,665 665,740 740,800 800,1025
Some databases in the relational

853
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:49,260
0,195 195,485
data model.|

854
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,605
0,245 245,350 350,470 470,575 575,665
And this is why I

855
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:51,265
0,105 105,300 300,420 420,555 555,660
was pissed all about the

856
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,075
0,315 315,450 450,585 585,690 690,810
jeopardy thing, because we go

857
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:54,460
0,195 195,515 1435,1950 1950,2130 2130,2385
back to Justin. The judges

858
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,125
0,380 430,810 810,1035 1035,1335 1335,1665
have reviewed your response of

859
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,550
0,720 720,855 855,1005 1005,1200 1200,1425
matrix in the Tech beat

860
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,930
0,320 400,675 675,825 825,1050 1050,1380
category and they have decided

861
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,895
0,240 240,375 375,650 850,1250 1630,1965
that it is correct. We've

862
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,305
0,180 180,630 630,965 1015,1245 1245,1410
added 800 dollars to your

863
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:03,265
0,270 270,480 480,645 645,810 810,960
score and all of your

864
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:05,020
0,480 480,705 705,930 930,1265 1405,1755
wagers were made on the

865
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,480
0,350 460,860
adjusted score.|

866
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,485
0,245 245,350 350,500 500,680 680,815
There is no such thing

867
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:09,140
0,105 105,195 195,450 450,1025
as a relational matrix.|

868
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,900
0,275 275,410 410,500 500,635 635,860
I sent them an email.

869
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,400
0,105 105,255 255,560 3760,4160
They didn't respond anyway.|

870
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,330
0,195 195,300 300,720 720,855 855,930
Got a PhD. I think

871
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,550
0,210 210,420 420,980 1630,1935 1935,2220
it's like neuroscience, but like,

872
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,720
0,210 210,440 940,1340 1750,2150 2770,3170
you know, whatever. So hopefully,

873
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,215
0,290 290,500 500,710 710,875 875,1055
if nothing else in this

874
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,850
0,305 955,1215 1215,1320 1320,1470 1470,1635
course, you can answer that

875
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,640
0,260
question.|

876
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,890
0,230 230,380 380,485 485,650 650,770
So let's go back to

877
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,840
0,75 75,540 540,830 1510,1770 1770,1950
the 1960 s and this

878
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,385
0,225 225,660 660,980 1030,1275 1275,1545
again motivate why the relational

879
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,740
0,330 330,600 600,905 1225,1625 1945,2355
model came about, and it'll

880
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,020
0,120 120,225 225,345 345,620 880,1280
set us up for why

881
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,515
0,365 365,545 545,950 950,1220 1220,1445
it's still prevalent and why

882
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,720
0,105 105,240 240,545
the youth today.|

883
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,100
0,260 260,520
Pin it.|

884
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,480
0,245 245,410 410,730
For any new.|

885
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,070
0,305 305,455 455,530 530,1415 1415,1700
Back in the 1960 s

886
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,580
0,345 345,710
early nineteen.|

887
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,815
0,400 630,1010 1010,1055 1055,1265 1265,1505
There wasn't a relational model,

888
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,015
0,255 255,450 450,900 900,975 975,1200
wasn't relational databases, it wasn't

889
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,005
0,330 330,450 450,615 615,720 720,990
postgres, it wasn't my sql

890
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:57,180
0,330 330,785 865,1265
sqlite mongo right.|

891
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,265
0,350 350,560 560,665 665,755 755,935
The first day he says

892
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,140
0,210 210,360 360,630 630,1025
we were building were.|

893
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,700
0,320 320,560 560,725 725,815 815,890
Not meant really meant to

894
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,615
0,105 105,300 300,600 600,825 825,915
be general purpose, but then

895
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,220
0,245 295,690 690,1085 1255,1500 1500,1605
they realize, oh, instead of

896
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,930
0,210 210,435 435,855 855,1160 1360,1710
building these bespoke database applications

897
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,565
0,210 210,405 405,740 1210,1470 1470,1635
or database systems for just

898
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,470
0,225 225,545 595,995 1465,1755 1755,1905
this one application, I can

899
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,250
0,135 135,255 255,360 360,525 525,780
make a bit more general

900
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,105
0,255 255,435 435,600 600,735 735,855
and and now I can

901
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:14,460
0,165 165,405 405,755 955,1355 1975,2355
support any possible application. So

902
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,225
0,270 270,420 420,540 540,645 645,765
as far as you know,

903
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,785
0,150 150,345 345,615 615,965 1165,1560
the first database system ever

904
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,780
0,575 1105,1365 1365,1625
existed, but I.|

905
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,005
0,290 290,530 530,800 800,1120 1320,1625
Built by general electric, which

906
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,530
0,285 285,600 600,885 885,1235 1945,2525
then then sold to Honeywell

907
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,150
0,670 900,1205 1205,1670 1670,1850 1850,2120
1960 with IDs they originally

908
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,520
0,345 345,585 585,860
built to keep.|

909
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,560
0,290 290,700 960,1205 1205,1295 1295,1460
In Seattle, and then they

910
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,000
0,225 225,530 820,1065 1065,1185 1185,1440
realize, oh, instead of building

911
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,640
0,285 285,465 465,600 600,860
this just for the.|

912
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,420
0,135 135,210 210,315 315,495 495,780
We can make some tweaks

913
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,065
0,105 105,210 210,330 330,495 495,645
and then make it so

914
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:35,520
0,245 595,900 900,1140 1140,1320 1320,1455
we paper company could use

915
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,285
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,600 600,765
it or, or a phone

916
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,635
0,195 195,375 375,495 495,755 1105,1350
company could use it. And

917
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:38,415
0,120 120,240 240,375 375,600 600,780
that sort of became one

918
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:39,260
0,60 60,150 150,330 330,540 540,845
of the first general purpose

919
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,700
0,320 320,575 575,845 845,1010 1010,1300
database systems that ever built.|

920
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,660
0,400
Ah.|

921
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,220
0,335 335,670
I met.|

922
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,860
0,290 290,440 440,575 575,740 740,920
Oh, we could use this

923
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,435
0,135 135,380 400,780 780,1160 1300,1575
for other applications, and they

924
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:55,700
0,375 375,695
generalized it.|

925
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,960
0,245 245,410 410,1090 1140,1540 1620,2020
And then codasil is a

926
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,645
0,400 540,940 1140,1540 1920,2320 2370,2675
standards that defined late sixty

927
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:03,235
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,995 1315,1590
s or seventy s as

928
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:05,785
0,150 150,405 405,785 2065,2325 2325,2550
a way to, as an

929
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:06,895
0,270 270,465 465,690 690,930 930,1110
interact way to interact with

930
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,965
0,210 210,545 1225,1590 1590,1890 1890,2070
data systems. People realize instead

931
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:09,970
0,90 90,255 255,480 480,735 735,1005
of having these standard, these

932
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,000
0,320
these.|

933
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,060
0,305 305,545 545,845 845,1055 1055,1160
Data systems that were being

934
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
0,135 135,240 240,330 330,590 940,1200
built at the time, we

935
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,400
0,105 105,350 370,780 780,975 975,1140
would have standardize way for

936
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,320
0,260
how.|

937
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,900
0,305 305,470 470,880 1020,1295 1295,1570
Less than 5% or five,

938
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,490
0,350 350,530 530,710 710,860 860,1040
I'm assuming you here are

939
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,000
0,150 150,270 270,405 405,830
heard a coat ofill.|

940
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,240
0,400 720,1120 1410,1810 2040,2440
One, okay? So why?|

941
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,750
0,230 230,320 320,580 2550,2780 2780,2840
In the book, in the

942
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,900
0,230 460,860
book, yeah.|

943
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,540
0,400
People.|

944
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,540
0,320 320,640 870,1115 1115,1220 1220,1370
And in, in these early

945
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,205
0,290 1030,1320 1320,1455 1455,1560 1560,1665
systems, this is the way

946
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:43,930
0,90 90,195 195,315 315,450 450,725
you would in interact with

947
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,700
0,335 335,670 1080,1480 1590,1865 1865,2030
database systems. And a lot

948
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,590
0,120 120,225 225,435 435,630 630,890
of the things that were

949
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,490
0,400 540,1190 1190,1385 1385,1580 1580,1790
in inherent in these first

950
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,305
0,530 1030,1320 1320,1515 1515,1680 1680,1815
implications are things you would

951
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:52,150
0,165 165,300 300,405 405,555 555,845
not want to do today.

952
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,555
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,605 605,815
So one of the big

953
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:54,545
0,270 270,525 525,690 690,810 810,990
things was in these first

954
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:55,595
0,255 255,465 465,600 600,795 795,1050
systems, they had this tight

955
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:57,760
0,465 465,815 1075,1350 1350,1875 1875,2165
coupling between the logical layer,

956
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,710
0,380 380,970 1890,2240 2240,2480 2480,2900
the schema, what what entities

957
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,310
0,120 120,210 210,375 375,525 525,600
do I have, what are

958
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,705
0,165 165,590 880,1140 1140,1245 1245,1395
their attributes, and then a

959
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:03,850
0,305 355,645 645,780 780,885 885,1145
physical layer in the system.|

960
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,595
0,290 290,500 500,710 710,950 950,1295
Meaning, like, how is actually

961
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,185
0,285 285,575 655,975 975,1440 1440,1590
being represented on disk or

962
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:08,295
0,165 165,455 625,885 885,1005 1005,1110
in memory and how would

963
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:09,290
0,135 135,360 360,585 585,735 735,995
I actually interact with them.|

964
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,535
0,400 810,1085 1085,1220 1220,1370 1370,1655
Right. And so what happened

965
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:12,720
0,375 375,630 630,825 825,1035 1035,1185
is if you, if you

966
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,650
0,165 165,360 360,750 750,825 825,930
were a programmer at the

967
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,805
0,260 490,750 750,855 855,990 990,1155
time and you wanted to

968
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:15,645
0,240 240,435 435,495 495,600 600,840
use one of these database

969
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:16,695
0,360 360,630 630,765 765,870 870,1050
systems, you had to know

970
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:18,660
0,335 415,815 1015,1305 1305,1770 1770,1965
exactly how the databaseases rest,

971
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,595
0,210 210,375 375,650 1360,1650 1650,1935
storing your database. And so

972
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:21,600
0,240 240,375 375,510 510,855 855,1005
because that would expose a

973
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,205
0,150 150,630 630,765 765,980 1270,1605
different API to you to

974
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:24,240
0,210 210,345 345,605
interact with it.|

975
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,815
0,230 230,305 305,695 695,890 890,1055
Well, on ims you could

976
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,135
0,305 445,750 750,915 915,1110 1110,1320
store data is either as

977
00:29:27,135 --> 00:29:28,020
0,135 135,360 360,585 585,780 780,885
a hash table or A

978
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,175
0,150 150,360 360,555 555,830 850,1155
B plus tree or tree

979
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,630
0,305 625,975 975,1200 1200,1335 1335,1455
structure and, and then you

980
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,910
0,180 180,405 405,980 1150,1550 2050,2280
got different APIs because you

981
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,675
0,105 105,270 270,435 435,585 585,765
know, depending on which data

982
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,625
0,225 225,450 450,695 1015,1415 1585,1950
structure we're using, because hash

983
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,980
0,165 165,345 345,585 585,845 925,1355
tables, you can't do scans

984
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,540
0,400 1680,1955 1955,2230
but treat structures.|

985
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,030
0,245 245,350 350,485 485,680 680,860
So now the problem with

986
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,545
0,135 135,285 285,560 880,1245 1245,1515
this is that any single

987
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:45,415
0,210 210,495 495,720 720,795 795,870
time I want to make

988
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,680
0,135 135,375 375,585 585,765 765,1265
a change to the schema

989
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
0,305 305,485 485,635 635,1040 1040,1160
at both the logical layer

990
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,390
0,105 105,210 210,450 450,830 940,1230
and the physical layer, I

991
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,400
0,150 150,255 255,405 405,735 735,1010
had to go rewrite my

992
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,740
0,400
application.|

993
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,870
0,245 245,425 425,760 780,1175 1175,1490
Almost from scratch because oh,

994
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,180
0,255 255,420 420,630 630,960 960,1310
how the database was represented

995
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,080
0,305 305,680 680,970
on disk changed.|

996
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,555
0,305 305,590 590,815 815,920 920,1115
Other issues with the data

997
00:29:58,555 --> 00:29:59,905
0,335 715,945 1020,1095 1095,1200 1200,1350
model, we don't need really

998
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:00,640
0,275
good.|

999
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,685
0,365 365,635 635,940 1680,2060 2060,2315
Like in the, the, the

1000
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,130
0,275 445,825 825,1065 1065,1185 1185,1445
higher model, you had to

1001
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,295
0,245 245,350 350,470 470,635 635,845
sort of have these four

1002
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:08,130
0,285 285,695 1165,1395 1395,1530 1530,1835
loops traverse, you know, one

1003
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,525
0,400 540,875 875,1130 1130,1450 1860,2105
collection versus another collection. It

1004
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,805
0,135 135,330 330,855 855,1145 1705,2280
was really inefficient, way inefficient

1005
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:13,375
0,105 105,255 255,405 405,495 495,570
way to interact with the

1006
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,440
0,165 165,485
data system.|

1007
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,135
0,305 305,575 575,860 860,1025 1025,1115
What happened was in the

1008
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:18,815
0,120 120,375 375,965 1315,1575 1575,1680
late nineteen sixties, there was

1009
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:20,510
0,135 135,420 420,750 750,1295 1435,1695
this guy, ted codd, who

1010
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,280
0,260
was.|

1011
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,380
0,400
Pen.|

1012
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,615
0,400 660,920 920,1055 1055,1330 1710,1985
And he was walking up

1013
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:29,425
0,165 165,390 390,570 570,645 645,810
in, in, in new York,

1014
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,250
0,180 180,255 255,375 375,570 570,825
where the big lab is,

1015
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,525
0,180 180,345 345,630 630,930 930,1275
and he saw all these,

1016
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,390
0,395 685,990 990,1455 1455,1775 2485,2865
these, these IBM developers primarily

1017
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,460
0,380
working.|

1018
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,145
0,305 305,530 530,1060 1680,2080 2130,2525
Saw them rewriting database applications

1019
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:39,315
0,330 330,510 510,690 690,930 930,1170
over and over again. Every

1020
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:40,140
0,240 240,435 435,570 570,675 675,825
single time there was a

1021
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,400
0,285 285,510 510,750 750,960 960,1260
schema change. Every single time

1022
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,760
0,380 1120,1395 1395,1620 1620,2055 2055,2360
was a physical layout change.|

1023
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,540
0,380
Right.|

1024
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,760
0,335 335,530 530,790
Humans were rapidly.|

1025
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,545
0,400 720,1120 1170,1430 1430,1550 1550,1715
So people, okay, yeah, we'll

1026
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:51,670
0,135 135,330 330,605 745,1005 1005,1125
just Mark humans at the

1027
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,400
0,240 240,620 730,990 990,1250 1330,1730
problem and, you know, and

1028
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,870
0,320 320,425 425,560 560,755 755,1090
that's better than buying a.|

1029
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,730
0,400 780,1100 1100,1420 1530,1805 1805,1970
So my example, he pointed

1030
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,520
0,290
out.|

1031
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,100
0,335 335,500 500,730
Embedded in my.|

1032
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,965
0,400 750,1085 1085,1420 1800,2075 2075,2165
So, main column, we think

1033
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,000
0,75 75,180 180,455
of it now.|

1034
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,950
0,165 165,315 315,590 700,945 945,1190
That was like the ID.|

1035
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,220
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,730
I had to go.|

1036
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,480
0,400
Meant.|

1037
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,220
0,245 245,500 500,710 710,860 860,950
A trivial example, but that

1038
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,775
0,105 105,195 195,300 300,420 420,555
was the kind of shit

1039
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:15,405
0,135 135,240 240,360 360,510 510,630
they were doing back in

1040
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:16,320
0,90 90,335
the day.|

1041
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,330
0,400 420,785 785,1085 1085,1295 1295,1430
So k, all this and

1042
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,470
0,120 120,435 435,825 825,1005 1005,1140
said there's, there's gotta be

1043
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,140
0,60 60,195 195,500 880,1275 1275,1670
a better way and he.|

1044
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,190
0,400 870,1265 1265,1655 1655,2315 2315,2620
Model as an abstraction from

1045
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,670
0,400 2070,2345 2345,2465 2465,2710 3030,3430
how, how to represent the

1046
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,160
0,290 290,580 1260,1610 1610,1960 2070,2470
a database and the relationship

1047
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,610
0,305 305,830 830,1070 1070,1190 1190,1310
between entities in and in

1048
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,355
0,135 135,410 940,1340 2140,2490 2490,2745
a database and avoid having

1049
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,980
0,195 195,405 405,840 840,1175 1225,1625
the tight coupling between physical

1050
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,835
0,400 600,965 965,1220 1220,1370 1370,1775
layer and in the logical

1051
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,695
0,275 535,935 1375,1650 1650,1755 1755,1860
layer meaning define it in

1052
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:43,540
0,585 585,875 1195,1485 1485,1650 1650,1845
mathematical terms. I had these

1053
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,980
0,320 340,690 690,765 765,1200 1200,1440
relations. Here's the manipulations or

1054
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,895
0,240 240,450 450,720 720,810 810,915
changes or lookups I could

1055
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,005
0,105 105,240 240,515 685,960 960,1110
do on them and I

1056
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,850
0,285 285,480 480,855 855,1145 1495,1845
don't know, don't care how

1057
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,915
0,210 210,435 435,690 690,885 885,1065
the database system underneath the

1058
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:50,830
0,225 225,510 510,705 705,795 795,915
covers is actually going to

1059
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,480
0,150 150,410
store it.|

1060
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,055
0,305 305,470 470,650 650,965 965,1235
Because the data system knows

1061
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:53,775
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,555 555,720
what the data is, knows

1062
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:54,750
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,665 715,975
what the queries are, it

1063
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,610
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,510 510,860
can be a better position

1064
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,020
0,305 305,530 530,785 785,1120
to decide how to.|

1065
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,140
0,260 260,520
And cut.|

1066
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,830
0,350 350,635 635,905 905,1235 1235,1580
I first proposed the relational

1067
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,320
0,225 225,465 465,660 660,920 1090,1490
data model in nineteen nine.|

1068
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,480
0,455 455,785 785,980 980,1175 1175,1450
There's it's Tech report paper.|

1069
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,780
0,400
Out.|

1070
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,240
0,400
That.|

1071
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,400
0,275 275,550 660,1390 1920,2180 2180,2420
And again, mathematician, he didn't

1072
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,665
0,225 225,525 525,890 1870,2130 2130,2265
define programming language at the

1073
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,625
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,780 780,960
time. He's not saying how

1074
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,080
0,180 180,375 375,585 585,905 1105,1455
you actually implement this. He's

1075
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,830
0,195 195,830 1150,1730 2050,2400 2400,2750
just defining whatational relations are

1076
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,715
0,305 305,470 470,980 980,1145 1145,1625
and the algebra to manipulate

1077
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:29,800
0,275
them.|

1078
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,780
0,400
Right.|

1079
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,050
0,290 290,560 560,770 770,1025 1025,1400
So there's three key tenets

1080
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,560
0,320 400,800
of, of.|

1081
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,580
0,230 230,335 335,470 470,590 590,710
But these are three ones

1082
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:37,925
0,90 90,150 150,195 195,255 255,345
that were going to care

1083
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,280
0,105 105,195 195,425
about the most.|

1084
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,905
0,260 260,395 395,590 590,785 785,935
So the first is that

1085
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,930
0,60 60,120 120,255 255,540 540,920
we're going to store all.|

1086
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,575
0,350 370,705 705,900 900,1160 1390,1755
Our collection of data in

1087
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:46,960
0,300 300,570 570,905
simple data structures.|

1088
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,470
0,400 1170,1490 1490,1565 1565,2015 2015,2260
I that's the mathematical term,

1089
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,760
0,275 275,410 410,515 515,635 635,910
same thing as a table.

1090
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,940
0,245 245,380 380,500 500,620 620,710
If you're coming from the

1091
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,720
0,300 300,450 450,600 600,705 705,780
mongol world, they call it

1092
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,610
0,105 105,380 1210,1560 1560,1680 1680,1890
a collection. It's the same

1093
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,560
0,350
idea.|

1094
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,840
0,260 260,470 470,725 725,950 950,1270
All these simple data structures,

1095
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,775
0,400 480,815 815,1085 1085,1385 1385,1895
I worry about all membership

1096
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,615
0,240 240,420 420,555 555,690 690,840
sets that all these other

1097
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,580
0,210 210,515
data sets.|

1098
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,970
0,305 305,470 470,590 590,740 740,800
Second is that you're going

1099
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,210
0,120 120,375 375,740 1120,1485 1485,2240
to keep the physical representation

1100
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,230
0,320 320,500 500,760 1260,1640 1640,1880
of the database itself, like

1101
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,340
0,150 150,330 330,510 510,690 690,1110
the actual bits and bytes

1102
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,740
0,255 255,795 795,1035 1035,1140 1140,1400
on disk or in memory,

1103
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,360
0,305 305,350 350,545 545,875 875,1150
you're going to leap that.|

1104
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,040
0,150 150,285 285,560
You, not it.|

1105
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,600
0,245 245,335 335,560 560,770 770,1060
In your relational data model.|

1106
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,295
0,305 305,500 500,635 635,710 710,845
Leave that for the data

1107
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:19,060
0,180 180,315 315,435 435,570 570,765
system and figure out what

1108
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,440
0,180 180,405 405,585 585,860
the best way to.|

1109
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,660
0,275 275,395 395,530 530,710 710,890
Right, because the idea now

1110
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,505
0,290 370,770 790,1050 1050,1310 1570,1845
is maybe if I store

1111
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,360
0,105 105,270 270,540 540,750 750,855
the data one way, but

1112
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,425
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,855 855,1065
then as I see what

1113
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:26,235
0,90 90,300 300,525 525,690 690,810
kind of data I'm putting

1114
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:27,710
0,305 775,1035 1035,1140 1140,1230 1230,1475
in, what kind of equipment,

1115
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,610
0,400 690,1010 1010,1295 1295,1565 1565,1850
comput data sets aside, oh,

1116
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,765
0,380 580,855 855,960 960,1050 1050,1155
I really want to store

1117
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:31,760
0,90 90,225 225,435 435,675 675,995
this on two machines or

1118
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,015
0,335 335,670 720,995 995,1145 1145,1235
files or or break it

1119
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:33,900
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,570 570,885
up in different ways or

1120
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,620
0,270 270,420 420,525 525,600 600,720
or sort it in one

1121
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,320
0,290 730,1020 1020,1215 1215,1410 1410,1700
way. And again now your

1122
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,385
0,305 305,620 620,910 1560,1865 1865,2045
application doesn't change because you're

1123
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:39,555
0,105 105,345 345,690 690,1065 1065,1170
just writing things queries at

1124
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,230
0,90 90,255 255,420 420,525 525,675
a high at a high

1125
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,100
0,290
level.|

1126
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,110
0,195 195,315 405,480 480,660 660,1010
And you don't really care

1127
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,400
0,400 510,875 875,1100 1100,1360
how underneath the covers.|

1128
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,180
0,335 335,515 515,770 770,1060 1110,1510
Right. And that's the here

1129
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,510
0,275 275,305 305,425 425,725 725,980
you're going to define. At

1130
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,425
0,120 120,300 300,555 555,765 765,915
a high level. You're going

1131
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,055
0,195 195,345 345,465 465,525 525,630
access data through a high

1132
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,420
0,180 180,485 835,1095 1095,1215 1215,1365
level language and then let

1133
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,610
0,150 150,360 360,645 645,885 885,1190
the data system figure out

1134
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,200
0,350 350,455 455,620 620,935 935,1330
what's the best way to,

1135
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,235
0,400 930,1445 1445,1535 1535,1700 1700,1865
to retrieve the data that

1136
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,345
0,150 150,255 255,545 595,885 885,1110
you're looking for. Do whatever

1137
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:58,550
0,335 355,615 615,780 780,945 945,1205
operation you want to do.|

1138
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,540
0,320 320,560 560,860 860,965 965,1070
So to Todd won the

1139
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,275
0,240 240,375 375,510 510,630 630,735
touring, won for this in

1140
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:05,170
0,1295 1915,2235 2235,2550 2550,2730 2730,2895
1981. {Ah,,event} coda. So he

1141
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,270
0,120 120,210 210,285 285,435 435,1100
won it in like 72

1142
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,735
0,335 335,530 530,695 695,890 890,1055
ah, but it took ten

1143
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:08,470
0,150 150,270 270,375 375,540 540,735
years for people to realize

1144
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,640
0,135 135,240 240,500
he was wrong.|

1145
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,230
0,290 1060,1460 2830,3195 3195,3315 3315,3590
And words. Todd is dead.

1146
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,200
0,305 305,610
The code.|

1147
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,880
0,245 245,470 470,850 1020,1265 1265,1430
And then the, the other

1148
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,800
0,195 195,315 315,420 420,600 600,920
guy that won the the

1149
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,180
0,320 320,590 590,785 785,1025 1025,1330
the touring ward in database,

1150
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,140
0,305 305,610 810,1055 1055,1190 1190,1370
gene gray, he got lost

1151
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,955
0,290 670,1070 1360,1605 1605,1710 1710,1815
in sixth. And then the

1152
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:26,755
0,245 565,965 1255,1590 1590,1695 1695,1800
last, the touring ward in

1153
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:28,110
0,180 180,420 420,615 615,795 795,1355
database is, is Mike stonebaker

1154
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,480
0,260 260,610 660,1210 1530,1790 1790,2050
and he's postcrib and was

1155
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,650
0,275 275,575 575,970 1230,1505 1505,1790
IP PhD advisor. Well, coververt

1156
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,460
0,410
stoneberg.|

1157
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,250
0,290 290,500 500,650 650,890 890,1130
So there's three key aspects

1158
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,705
0,165 165,375 375,600 600,890 1090,1455
of the data model. There's

1159
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,610
0,150 150,435 435,815 1405,1710 1710,1905
the structure that, how we're

1160
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,885
0,60 60,290 610,870 870,1035 1035,1275
going to, how we define

1161
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:42,310
0,195 195,315 315,575 805,1185 1185,1425
what the data database actually

1162
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,975
0,260 520,840 840,1425 1425,1500 1500,1665
is, what what's in our

1163
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:45,580
0,305 775,1020 1020,1095 1095,1275 1275,1605
relations, what are their attributes

1164
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,590
0,135 135,270 270,560 1360,1800 1800,2010
and the types. There's the

1165
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,765
0,560 580,945 945,1310 1330,1920 1920,2175
integrity methods that specify what

1166
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:50,560
0,195 195,375 375,540 540,645 645,795
data is allowed to be

1167
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,400
0,315 315,510 510,615 615,860
stored in the database.|

1168
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,225
0,305 305,440 440,560 560,695 695,785
Right to make sure that

1169
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,620
0,90 90,335 355,755
you know every.|

1170
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,135
0,400 420,650 650,755 755,800 800,935
Email. I don't have any

1171
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,340
0,240 240,480 480,675 675,885 885,1205
records without an email address

1172
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,100
0,335 335,515 515,650 650,940
or in my example.|

1173
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,840
0,275 275,545 545,680 680,970 1080,1480
I can't have an album

1174
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,605
0,400 510,770 770,875 875,1055 1055,1235
that has an artist that

1175
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:03,510
0,300 300,465 465,570 570,660 660,905
doesn't exist in the artist.|

1176
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,980
0,260 260,380 380,485 485,1030 1350,1970
And then the manipulation mechanisms

1177
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,165
0,195 195,470 520,780 780,975 975,1185
allow us to define how

1178
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:09,810
0,180 180,210 210,330 330,510 510,645
we're going to access the

1179
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,660
0,260 370,705 705,900 900,1160
data and update it.|

1180
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,580
0,380 400,750 750,1100 1420,1725 1725,1920
And what about the last

1181
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,120
0,150 150,255 255,345 345,465 465,540
one was what we'll talk

1182
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,990
0,260 370,600 600,675 675,765 765,870
about when we start talking

1183
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,780
0,260
about.|

1184
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
0,400
Matt.|

1185
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,170
0,290 290,785 785,1090 1560,1960 2250,2630
An unordered set of data

1186
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,130
0,300 300,375 375,510 510,735 735,960
that's going to contain the

1187
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,530
0,255 255,570 570,930 930,1140 1140,1400
relationship of attributes that represent

1188
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,815
0,305 305,785 785,905 905,1025 1025,1205
some entity in the real

1189
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:29,440
0,305 805,1080 1080,1355 1945,2295 2295,2625
world. So the model doesn't

1190
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,990
0,150 150,285 285,530 550,950 1150,1550
mean the relationship between tables,

1191
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,620
0,320 320,440 440,590 590,850 870,1250
it's really the relationship between

1192
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,820
0,470
attributes.|

1193
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,120
0,400
Within.|

1194
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,490
0,285 285,615 615,855 855,1095 1095,1290
So again, a student has

1195
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,540
0,180 180,420 420,675 675,870 870,1050
an email address. They have

1196
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,470
0,210 210,405 405,710 2380,2655 2655,2930
a phone number, a birthday

1197
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,230
0,320 320,640 990,1450 1740,2090 2090,2440
home, address it, that relation

1198
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,475
0,260 260,520 750,1210 1410,1805 1805,2135
of those attributes combined together

1199
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,460
0,285 285,635 745,1145
to represent some.|

1200
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,255
0,400 840,1130 1130,1415 1415,1700 1700,1805
So again, so we'll have

1201
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:53,770
0,135 135,240 240,405 405,815 1105,1515
a set of attributes. I'll

1202
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,940
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,590 850,1170
use the word triple, but

1203
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,130
0,270 270,570 570,765 765,900 900,1190
it also you mean record

1204
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,410
0,400 690,1090 2220,2620 2760,3020 3020,3140
or row, again at a

1205
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,130
0,150 150,315 315,435 435,570 570,720
high level, they all mean

1206
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,290
0,135 135,315 315,600 600,870 870,1160
the same way, same thing.|

1207
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,900
0,275 275,485 485,710 710,1000
And so for the.|

1208
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,905
0,400 540,845 845,1150 1440,1685 1685,1835
For every single in the

1209
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:08,975
0,305 1285,1650 1650,1845 1845,1890 1890,2070
original definition of the relational

1210
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,580
0,225 225,515 865,1200 1200,1395 1395,1605
data model, all the values

1211
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,480
0,210 210,285 285,345 345,765 765,900
have to be atomic or

1212
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,540
0,530
scalar.|

1213
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,860
0,275 275,470 470,710 710,995 995,1280
But again, as things have

1214
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,820
0,320 460,795 795,1130
evolved over time.|

1215
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,875
0,305 305,590 590,800 800,1100 1100,1235
Again, CoD didn't foresee these

1216
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,835
0,195 195,375 375,480 480,585 585,960
things back in the seventies,

1217
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:22,840
0,210 210,485
this is.|

1218
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,160
0,260 260,395 395,670
Support this today.|

1219
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,735
0,230 230,305 305,550 960,1340 1340,1565
And of course, all to

1220
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:29,080
0,105 105,365 1135,1535 1855,2100 2100,2345
be there so we can

1221
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,580
0,320 320,545 545,850 1020,1420
in some cases, a.|

1222
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,795
0,240 240,525 525,800 820,1080 1080,1215
Some attributes could have a

1223
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,085
0,255 255,510 510,735 735,1065 1065,1290
value that is null, meaning

1224
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:35,110
0,300 300,510 510,630 630,750 750,1025
it's unknown at the time,

1225
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,530
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,680 680,1040
and again, you can specify

1226
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,340
0,105 105,225 225,510 510,645 645,810
in the schema whether you

1227
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,180
0,290 1150,1550 1720,2040 2040,2360
want an to support.|

1228
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,650
0,400 570,815 815,1025 1025,1390 1560,1910
So in every relation, there's

1229
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,900
0,90 90,195 195,470 640,945 945,1250
going to be a primary

1230
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,485
0,400 900,1370 1370,1430 1430,1475 1475,1565
key that's going to be

1231
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:50,345
0,180 180,345 345,905 925,1325 1555,1860
used to uniquely identify a

1232
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:51,965
0,455 895,1200 1200,1365 1365,1485 1485,1620
tple. Again, think of like

1233
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,120
0,180 180,360 360,615 615,960 960,1155
your student ID, your android

1234
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,640
0,230 400,765 765,990 990,1185 1185,1520
ID here at the university.|

1235
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,160
0,335 335,605 605,785 785,935 935,1240
Allows us to know exactly,

1236
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,940
0,230 230,460
you know.|

1237
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,600
0,275 275,550 630,890 890,1025 1025,1300
Or record that we want

1238
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,860
0,230 230,365 365,580
when we're doing.|

1239
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,900
0,365 365,730
Example here.|

1240
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,825
0,400 2160,2560 2970,3320 3320,3650 3650,3875
A particular particular entry in

1241
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,865
0,245 745,1145 1375,1725 1725,1905 1905,2040
our but your android ID

1242
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,425
0,180 180,455 1045,1305 1305,1440 1440,1560
is unique and that so

1243
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:29,150
0,120 120,270 270,375 375,465 465,725
that would be a primary

1244
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,580
0,400 1530,1880 1880,2135 2135,2440
for the university database.|

1245
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,485
0,275 275,380 380,470 470,590 590,725
What you can do in

1246
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,660
0,240 240,480 480,645 795,915 915,1175
cases where you don't have.|

1247
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,200
0,400
Private.|

1248
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,580
0,350 350,700
Identity column.|

1249
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,180
0,260 260,485 485,850
The primary key.|

1250
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,065
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,575 575,755
You see this a lot

1251
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,480
0,225 225,750 750,990 990,1125 1125,1415
in om, if you like.|

1252
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,500
0,365 365,590 590,815 815,950 950,1160
Sql I if you're using

1253
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,805
0,285 285,650 880,1110 1110,1200 1200,1305
node JS, a lot of

1254
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,280
0,245 595,995 1795,2235 2235,2340 2340,2475
times these frameworks will make

1255
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,960
0,255 255,770 1360,1755 1755,2150
these primaries for exist.|

1256
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,630
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,710 710,1090
And so the primary key

1257
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,805
0,400 570,970 1290,1565 1565,2080 2430,2705
is, is a constraint that

1258
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:06,020
0,150 150,405 405,720 720,960 960,1215
the database management system will

1259
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,875
0,270 270,450 450,600 600,750 750,855
enforce for you on your

1260
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,290
0,240 240,575 685,960 960,1125 1125,1415
relational data. Make sure that

1261
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,070
0,320 320,515 515,740 740,1090 1320,1640
within any given relation there

1262
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,370
0,210 210,480 480,860 1000,1400 1900,2300
does not exist a multiple

1263
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,060
0,400 420,680 680,830 830,1120 1260,1640
records with the same primary

1264
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,900
0,380
key.|

1265
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,260
0,275 275,395 395,485 485,620 620,910
Talk about how to do

1266
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,995
0,305 305,560 560,1060 1140,1430 1430,1565
automatic identity columns throughout the

1267
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:21,140
0,210 210,345 345,510 510,750 750,1145
semester, but there's basically ways

1268
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,130
0,400 510,910 1200,1460 1460,1640 1640,1820
data system can generate these

1269
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,320
0,255 255,405 405,680
columns for you.|

1270
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,175
0,365 365,730 1230,1490 1490,1625 1625,1775
Foreign keys and this is

1271
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:30,870
0,180 180,390 390,990 990,1485 1485,1695
to enforce referential integrity to

1272
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,355
0,150 150,465 465,860 1060,1320 1320,1485
make sure that if I

1273
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:36,390
0,305 805,1205 3115,3495 3495,3780 3780,4035
have a two in one

1274
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,380
0,350
relation.|

1275
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,565
0,515 515,785 785,1100 1100,1660 1770,2075
Refers to another tuol in

1276
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:41,380
0,240 240,575 1225,1515 1515,1650 1650,1815
another relation that the day

1277
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,620
0,240 240,540 540,920 1780,2010 2010,2240
minimum assessment you, you know,

1278
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,030
0,260 260,590 590,770 770,1040 1040,1390
an orphan or or, or

1279
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,395
0,380 380,760 1080,1480 1710,2015 2015,2225
a broken because you you

1280
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:48,580
0,180 180,315 315,555 555,915 915,1185
delete the record from one

1281
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,220
0,290 670,930 930,1050 1050,1365 1365,1640
row, still a dangley point

1282
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,500
0,290 290,500 500,820
and another row.|

1283
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,615
0,305 305,500 500,710 710,950 950,1145
Going back here to our

1284
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,720
0,275
database.|

1285
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,000
0,400 780,1180
In state.|

1286
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,910
0,400 720,995 995,1100 1100,1190 1190,1340
But say we have this

1287
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,935
0,195 195,405 405,710 1180,1580 1780,2025
mix tape here, right? We

1288
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:13,625
0,75 75,180 180,330 330,450 450,690
have a bunch of artists

1289
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,780
0,255 255,360 360,605
appear on it.|

1290
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,380
0,260 260,335 335,550
How do we?|

1291
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,280
0,260 260,380 380,530 530,820
On this mix tape.|

1292
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
0,225 225,450 450,690 690,870 870,1280
And I, the fourth relational

1293
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,700
0,305 305,755 755,965 965,1085 1085,1250
support arrays, least the original

1294
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,860
0,225 225,375 375,620
version of it.|

1295
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,370
0,400 1110,1355 1355,1595 1595,1895 1895,2200
So in the data model,

1296
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,510
0,275 275,425 425,530 530,620 620,880
do this, you would have

1297
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,840
0,275 275,455 455,725 725,1090
a cross reference table.|

1298
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,960
0,350 350,560 560,695 695,860 860,1040
Where I can keep track

1299
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,510
0,225 225,405 405,615 615,1040 1150,1550
of the unique pairs of

1300
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,485
0,275 275,550 690,1025 1025,1205 1205,1385
the relationships between the artists

1301
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:40,940
0,195 195,300 300,725
and the albums.|

1302
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,060
0,400 810,1100 1100,1390 1440,1840
Right. And now again.|

1303
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,705
0,380 380,760 960,1205 1205,1325 1325,1475
Again, it does it for

1304
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:23,365
0,195 195,345 345,420 420,525 525,660
you, so you just write

1305
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:25,600
0,120 120,300 300,555 555,875
the same delete command.|

1306
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,280
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,590 590,770
The key is not all

1307
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,160
0,135 135,380
to do.|

1308
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,660
0,400
You.|

1309
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,250
0,400 420,820 960,1360 1680,2060 2060,2440
My kind with pipeline code,

1310
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,610
0,410 410,500 500,650 650,800 800,950
I'd have to do all

1311
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,020
0,255 255,615 615,900 900,1140 1140,1410
that myself in my application

1312
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,250
0,255 255,465 465,675 675,900 900,1230
code to follow those pointers,

1313
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:36,910
0,135 135,270 270,435 435,555 555,660
to go find the things

1314
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,570
0,165 165,285 285,450 450,540 540,660
I'm looking for, to make

1315
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,230
0,180 180,285 285,360 360,540 540,660
sure that I don't have

1316
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,180
0,290 1480,1880 1930,2570
these, these dependencies.|

1317
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,085
0,230 230,335 335,485 485,635 635,785
The way you do this

1318
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,300
0,275
is.|

1319
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,745
0,260 260,680 680,995 995,1360 1410,1715
Throw errors if, if you're

1320
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:07,800
0,45 45,120 120,515
going to violate.|

1321
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,600
0,245 245,490 690,920 920,995 995,1240
The last, you can have

1322
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,420
0,820
constraints.|

1323
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,650
0,335 335,670 1110,1370 1370,1475 1475,1580
Protection mechanism. You can have

1324
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,385
0,105 105,240 240,390 390,525 525,735
the data system in force

1325
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:18,960
0,180 180,330 330,525 525,815 1195,1575
to make sure that data

1326
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,500
0,380 610,1010 1090,1490 1900,2220 2220,2540
follows the proper has values

1327
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,160
0,335 335,620 620,1130 1130,1370 1370,1520
that that conform to some

1328
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,455
0,105 105,195 195,440 1900,2160 2160,2295
kind of domain or that

1329
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:26,160
0,275
you.|

1330
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,540
0,380
Um.|

1331
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,395
0,60 60,120 120,255 255,525 525,765
You don't have values or

1332
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:30,315
0,135 135,345 345,605 1495,1755 1755,1920
two poles that take you

1333
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,160
0,305 385,735 735,1005 1005,1325
scre and other things.|

1334
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,530
0,350 350,700 720,995 995,1115 1115,1250
The idea that you can

1335
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,040
0,500 1120,1515 1515,1755 1755,2000 2050,2510
specify for a given attribute.|

1336
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,880
0,305 305,590 590,860 860,1150 1860,2120
Or within the global, with

1337
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,870
0,135 135,360 360,645 645,780 780,990
a given attribute or given

1338
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,715
0,350 370,660 660,915 915,1280 1570,1845
table across multiple tables. I

1339
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:43,680
0,270 270,665 1285,1605 1605,1815 1815,1965
can have every single time

1340
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,225
0,105 105,210 210,315 315,740 1270,1545
I make a modification or

1341
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:46,170
0,150 150,285 285,435 435,795 795,945
any of these constraints being

1342
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,645
0,530 1030,1430 1450,1800 1800,2150 2230,2475
violated, if if yes, then

1343
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:49,520
0,150 150,345 345,465 465,585 585,875
I throw an error and,

1344
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,325
0,245 245,350 350,500 500,590 590,695
and I don't let you

1345
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,960
0,165 165,360 360,540 540,845 1375,1635
make make any changes. So

1346
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,265
0,260 580,870 870,990 990,1095 1095,1305
again, back to the example.

1347
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:54,180
0,195 195,315 315,405 405,635 655,915
She brought it before. Well,

1348
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,380
0,105 105,225 225,435 435,770 880,1200
what if someone writes a

1349
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,960
0,240 240,555 555,930 930,1245 1245,1580
string character in your column?|

1350
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,260
0,330 330,585 585,915 915,1280
For my CS file.|

1351
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,805
0,260 260,425 425,605 605,755 755,875
The Davis system might actually

1352
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:01,615
0,150 150,300 300,405 405,570 570,810
prevent you from doing that

1353
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:02,320
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,585 585,705
if you had these in

1354
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,510
0,255 255,570 570,735 735,885 885,1190
category sh because would know,

1355
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,645
0,245 245,395 395,470 470,590 590,725
okay, you're trying to store

1356
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:05,500
0,275
something.|

1357
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,460
0,245 245,350 350,515 515,710 710,950
Try to sort a character

1358
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,140
0,350 400,675 675,1020 1020,1280 1390,1680
into an integer column. I

1359
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,740
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,495 495,600
can't let you do that

1360
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,120
0,240 240,465 465,710
in an error.|

1361
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,555
0,245 245,335 335,425 425,575 575,785
You can do other things

1362
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:12,940
0,225 225,465 465,705 705,1005 1005,1385
like make sure that the

1363
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,300
0,290 290,530 530,740 740,845 845,950
the year has to be

1364
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,830
0,165 165,470 580,1200 1200,1365 1365,1530
greater than 100 or greater

1365
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,080
0,225 225,530
than zero.|

1366
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,720
0,230 230,305 305,425 425,635 635,890
And the d system will

1367
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,360
0,210 210,390 390,555 555,830
enforce that for you.|

1368
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,750
0,245 245,395 395,620 620,965 965,1040
The most common constraints that

1369
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,880
0,60 60,180 180,470
are out there.|

1370
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,210
0,290 290,440 440,620 620,770 770,1000
Things could happen for you.|

1371
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,440
0,260 260,410 410,500 500,590 590,680
And doesn't let you make

1372
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,880
0,120 120,380
the change.|

1373
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,915
0,275 275,410 410,605 605,905 905,1115
But again, we find this

1374
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:54,890
0,105 105,270 270,615 615,810 810,975
in our schema and, and

1375
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,595
0,105 105,315 315,405 405,495 495,705
the racial name is doesn't

1376
00:42:55,595 --> 00:42:57,110
0,165 165,330 330,605 775,1175 1225,1515
make sure that the going

1377
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,910
0,290 430,705 705,980 1450,1695 1695,1800
enforce. So now you know

1378
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,400
0,225 225,585 585,825 825,1070
matter if you know.|

1379
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,795
0,550 960,1460 1460,1780 2190,2450 2450,2555
Python he's jail. You have

1380
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:05,025
0,165 165,330 330,480 480,785 955,1230
to start making changes. They

1381
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:05,895
0,255 255,480 480,585 585,765 765,870
know you know what's going

1382
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:07,620
0,120 120,195 195,270 270,515 1255,1725
on in the database. Datison

1383
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,450
0,150 150,315 315,420 420,540 540,830
will prevent you from shooting

1384
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,810
0,290 290,425 425,545 545,820 1080,1340
shell from the foot and

1385
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,140
0,195 195,530
making changes.|

1386
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,020
0,260 260,790
These constraints.|

1387
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,355
0,230 230,365 365,530 530,680 680,845
All right, so now we've

1388
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:20,850
0,45 45,120 120,210 210,345 345,495
got to talk about how

1389
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,540
0,150 150,270 270,345 345,480 480,690
we actually want to interact

1390
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,535
0,165 165,410 910,1260 1260,1610 1750,1995
the database. Assuming we set

1391
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,380
0,245 625,960 960,1230 1230,1515 1515,1845
up, we define what, what

1392
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,505
0,255 255,480 480,735 735,960 960,1125
our database and relations are

1393
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:28,605
0,60 60,105 105,210 210,485 1855,2100
going to look like. We

1394
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:29,385
0,75 75,135 135,225 225,485 535,780
want to talk about how

1395
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:31,640
0,150 150,315 315,465 465,755
we actually want to.|

1396
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,800
0,260 260,395 395,680 680,800 800,1060
To run queries on it.|

1397
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,980
0,400 810,1070 1070,1190 1190,1355 1355,1550
So at a high level,

1398
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,090
0,225 225,375 375,630 630,945 945,1110
there's two basic approaches to

1399
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,695
0,90 90,350 640,1005 1005,1080 1080,1605
do this. There's the procedural

1400
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,960
0,300 300,540 540,945 945,1235
and non procedural languages.|

1401
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,020
0,335 335,670
The exact.|

1402
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,480
0,260 260,365 365,500 500,790
What the day assessment?|

1403
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:46,865
0,260 260,350 350,425 425,515 515,605
Whatever it is that you

1404
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:47,640
0,245
want.|

1405
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,560
0,400
The.|

1406
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,860
0,350
The.|

1407
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,560
0,290 290,695 695,970 1200,1565 1565,1850
Non procedural one is where

1408
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,955
0,150 150,270 270,560 880,1290 1290,1395
you would say, here's the

1409
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:56,675
0,180 180,390 390,525 525,630 630,720
answer, I want you to

1410
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,040
0,425 625,870 870,1020 1020,1140 1140,1365
compute. I don't know how

1411
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,570
0,165 165,435 435,710 1030,1335 1335,1530
to compute it, you figure

1412
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,560
0,135 135,380
it out.|

1413
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,020
0,335 335,790
So relational.|

1414
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,640
0,400 540,940 990,1475 1475,1625 1625,1910
And the sql or relational

1415
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,710
0,450 450,585 585,705 705,810 810,1070
calculus is going to be

1416
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,675
0,305 305,830 830,1480 1860,2150 2150,2255
non procedural, declarative. We're not

1417
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:10,305
0,105 105,180 180,285 285,375 375,630
going to cover a relational

1418
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:11,820
0,465 465,645 645,765 765,1115 1255,1515
calculus because you don't know

1419
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,540
0,260
it.|

1420
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,400
0,245 245,490 780,1160 1160,1325 1325,1790
You know, I've never usedial

1421
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,550
0,270 270,375 375,620 910,1310 2830,3150
calculus, have you? Never, only

1422
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,615
0,180 180,345 345,650 670,930 930,1065
the theory papers, which we're

1423
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,215
0,90 90,255 255,375 375,525 525,600
not doing, we don't care

1424
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:21,860
0,245
about.|

1425
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,565
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,525 525,705
But it is. It is.

1426
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:23,590
0,330 330,570 570,660 660,765 765,1025
House is going to work

1427
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,145
0,275 275,410 410,650 650,905 905,1025
if your baby putting a

1428
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,950
0,225 225,635 1075,1650 1650,2015 2545,2805
query, optimize calculus, but in

1429
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,080
0,120 120,255 255,530
the real world.|

1430
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,900
0,260 260,500 500,1115 1115,1415 1415,1610
But relational algebra is not

1431
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,720
0,290
something.|

1432
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,640
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,480 480,740
You don't get the job,

1433
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,120
0,260 260,395 395,575 575,880
but this will be.|

1434
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,285
0,245 245,335 335,580 1920,2300 2300,2615
We want to to run

1435
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:39,425
0,345 345,480 480,705 705,945 945,1140
queries and build execution engine.

1436
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:40,460
0,180 180,315 315,465 465,750 750,1035
All the things we later

1437
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,770
0,290 640,900 900,990 990,1065 1065,1310
on we want to call

1438
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,800
0,440 440,635 635,695 695,815 815,980
relational at a high level.

1439
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,285
0,135 135,380 460,860 1000,1305 1305,1485
And then, yes, we'll go

1440
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,840
0,335 535,855 855,1175
over through the.|

1441
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,285
0,350 520,920 1630,1890 1890,2145 2145,2445
The course is the modern

1442
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,480
0,300 300,435 435,695
variance of it.|

1443
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,360
0,365 365,725 725,1120
Alright, so the.|

1444
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,760
0,400
Uh.|

1445
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,520
0,380
Rac.|

1446
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,570
0,640 900,1205 1205,1415 1415,1720 1770,2120
69 you also define the

1447
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,670
0,225 225,830 1600,1860 1860,1965 1965,2100
the algebra that you would

1448
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,795
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,900 900,1125
use to interact with database

1449
00:45:02,795 --> 00:45:03,875
0,240 240,465 465,705 705,810 810,1080
system, and it's the way

1450
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,800
0,395 835,1185 1185,1470 1470,1665 1665,1925
to extract data from it.|

1451
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,220
0,400 630,1025 1025,1300 1380,1655 1655,1790
And compute answers that you

1452
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,100
0,260
want.|

1453
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,450
0,260 260,455 455,770 770,1085 1085,1340
So its original paper, he

1454
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,045
0,320 790,1125 1125,1425 1425,1970 2290,2595
defined seven fundamental operators it

1455
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,280
0,180 180,420 420,665
since it's been.|

1456
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,725
0,380 1720,2055 2055,2235 2235,2340 2340,2445
Additional operations you need in

1457
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:20,375
0,245 265,665 925,1230 1230,1410 1410,1650
modern applications like this doesn't

1458
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,640
0,180 180,665
have sorting.|

1459
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,305
0,320 320,640 810,1145 1145,1325 1325,1475
And obviously, applications you need

1460
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,240
0,300 300,420 420,525 525,660 660,935
sorting, so that came later.|

1461
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,670
0,400 990,1340 1340,1550 1550,1670 1670,1760
But all this is going

1462
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,760
0,45 45,135 135,375 375,740
to be based on.|

1463
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,645
0,245 245,490 900,1400 1400,1750 2250,2645
To order lists of records

1464
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:35,165
0,255 255,755 1825,2100 2100,2295 2295,2520
or duplicate on order list

1465
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,385
0,210 210,665 1495,1740 1740,1935 1935,2220
of twoils, but without any

1466
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:38,720
0,605
duplicates.|

1467
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,340
0,400 420,740 740,860 860,1070 1070,1490
Now, what's been slightly confusing

1468
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,220
0,210 210,470 580,975 975,1320 1320,1880
is that in, in sql

1469
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,820
0,400 450,740 740,950 950,1010 1010,1100
by default it's going to

1470
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,070
0,105 105,180 180,330 330,600 600,1250
try to use bag algebra,

1471
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,135
0,260 260,395 395,670 810,1100 1100,1595
which is basically an unordered

1472
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,670
0,255 255,540 540,795 795,1020 1020,1535
set that does have duplicates

1473
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,135
0,260 260,500 500,800 800,875 875,965
or sometimes it's called a

1474
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:52,175
0,210 210,575 835,1235 1705,1950 1950,2040
multi set. Um, and the

1475
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:53,360
0,180 180,450 450,870 870,1080 1080,1185
reason why sql wants to

1476
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,395
0,120 120,405 405,645 645,765 765,1035
use bags instead of sets,

1477
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:55,805
0,255 255,495 495,785 1015,1275 1275,1410
because it's actually you be

1478
00:45:55,805 --> 00:45:56,705
0,180 180,420 420,615 615,720 720,900
more efficient if you don't

1479
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:58,055
0,105 105,365 475,840 840,1170 1170,1350
care about removing duplicates later

1480
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:58,740
0,305
on.|

1481
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,600
0,425 425,500 500,575 575,680 680,800
Algebra that we care about

1482
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,605
0,260 460,735 735,855 855,975 975,1005
here, we assume we're going

1483
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:02,300
0,45 45,120 120,195 195,270 270,695
to get rid of delegates.|

1484
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,055
0,245 245,335 335,560 560,785 785,875
So the basic idea of

1485
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:05,435
0,120 120,270 270,755 985,1245 1245,1380
all these operators is that

1486
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:07,420
0,150 150,225 225,485 505,905 1585,1985
you're going take some, some,

1487
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,950
0,290 290,485 485,650 650,860 860,1210
some relation as your input

1488
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,015
0,320 320,500 500,605 605,850 1440,1685
or one or more of

1489
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:12,365
0,150 150,575 715,960 960,1110 1110,1350
your inputs and then you're,

1490
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:13,010
0,150 150,195 195,285 285,420 420,645
you're going to do some

1491
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,170
0,270 270,465 465,720 720,930 930,1160
operation on them and then

1492
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,485
0,260 260,410 410,620 620,860 860,1055
produce a new relation as

1493
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:16,580
0,225 225,575
the output.|

1494
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,825
0,260 260,350 350,440 440,700 840,1205
And you can start chaining

1495
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,900
0,240 240,545 1105,1380 1380,1740 1740,2075
all these, these operators together

1496
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,250
0,245 245,365 365,640 660,965 965,1270
to do more complex things.|

1497
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,465
0,45 45,105 105,240 240,360 360,435
So we'll go through each

1498
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:24,130
0,75 75,180 180,300 300,405 405,665
of these one by one.|

1499
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,005
0,485 485,755 755,1000 1200,1445 1445,1565
Innovations aren't working. I don't

1500
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:27,940
0,75 75,270 270,450 450,660 660,935
know why, but that's okay,

1501
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,910
0,350 350,545 545,650 650,770 770,1030
showing everything all at once.|

1502
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,425
0,305 305,610 660,1010 1010,1265 1265,1415
First, use as select, but

1503
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:41,450
0,75 75,165 165,270 270,515 625,1025
I think the original paper

1504
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,450
0,290 290,545 545,910 2340,2645 2645,2950
calls that restrict thing right?

1505
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,675
0,260 260,425 425,515 515,680 680,875
But you're trying to restrict

1506
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:48,180
0,150 150,425 925,1475 2065,2325 2325,2505
the two etiquette and the

1507
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,995
0,320 580,930 930,1215 1215,1530 1530,1815
idea in your select operator,

1508
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:51,015
0,195 195,255 255,360 360,635 715,1020
you're going to define first

1509
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:53,600
0,270 270,660 660,935 1525,1920 1920,2585
order predicate logic to specify

1510
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,790
0,350 350,710 710,965 965,1330 1590,1990
what tubol will match what

1511
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,465
0,380 380,760 990,1280 1280,1445 1445,1565
select operator is trying to

1512
00:46:57,465 --> 00:46:58,160
0,245
do.|

1513
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,290
0,425 425,800 800,1010 1010,1360 1740,2140
It's boolean logic, like something

1514
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,455
0,275 275,530 530,770 770,935 935,1115
equals something or something less

1515
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:03,775
0,150 150,425 865,1125 1125,1230 1230,1320
than something, but you can

1516
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:05,665
0,105 105,720 720,1065 1065,1335 1335,1890
have conjunctions and or disjunctions,

1517
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:07,460
0,335
or.|

1518
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,380
0,290 290,580 600,890 890,1180
PR is down below.|

1519
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,115
0,400 420,680 680,815 815,1025 1025,1265
On whatever your target table

1520
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:54,960
0,305
is.|

1521
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,420
0,335 335,575 575,880 1260,1870
Next operator is projection.|

1522
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,245
0,305 305,395 395,515 515,620 620,785
I'm not good at Greek

1523
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:03,055
0,330 330,465 465,585 585,690 690,810
symbols for this one, it's

1524
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:03,955
0,90 90,225 225,435 435,705 705,900
easy to remember because it's

1525
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:06,860
0,75 75,335 355,755 985,1385
a low pi symbol.|

1526
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,080
0,260 260,440 440,665 665,970
And the idea here?|

1527
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,370
0,290 290,455 455,680 680,1030 1530,1930
As as your input and

1528
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,390
0,605 605,815 815,995 995,1190 1190,1340
specify what you want to

1529
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,490
0,150 150,315 315,585 585,840 840,1100
be in the output of

1530
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,105
0,400 510,845 845,1010 1010,1085 1085,1235
of the output of the

1531
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,620
0,305 625,870 870,960 960,1095 1095,1515
operator so you can rearrange

1532
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,730
0,300 300,540 540,825 825,915 915,1110
the the ordering of the

1533
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,205
0,410 820,1125 1125,1430 1750,2150 2170,2475
attributes, you can remove attributes.

1534
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:23,700
0,105 105,360 360,645 645,1115
You don't, you don't.|

1535
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,230
0,260 260,350 350,425 425,530 530,1130
And then you can manipulate

1536
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,570
0,180 180,440 520,765 765,930 930,1340
the values of the attributes

1537
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,450
0,400 930,1235 1235,1490 1490,1840 2160,2560
to to generate new value.|

1538
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,665
0,400 1260,1595 1595,1760 1760,1880 1880,2105
Um, again. But it's only

1539
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:35,050
0,285 285,435 435,695 1405,2220 2220,2385
operating on whatever that's given

1540
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,860
0,150 150,380
to it.|

1541
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,350
0,260 260,635 635,1000 1260,1505 1505,1750
To subtract by a hundred.|

1542
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,490
0,245 245,380 380,670 870,1450 2070,2470
So now we operators that.|

1543
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,450
0,400 1410,1670 1670,1850 1850,2170 2850,3230
Take that, take multiple relations

1544
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,820
0,255 255,465 465,800
as their input.|

1545
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,200
0,305 305,470 470,620 620,800 800,1090
So in the, in the,

1546
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,725
0,260 260,380 380,640 720,980 980,1115
in the union operator, it's

1547
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:16,655
0,60 60,360 360,630 630,840 840,930
a binary operator, so you

1548
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:18,650
0,245 895,1275 1275,1590 1590,1815 1815,1995
can use operation from set

1549
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,600
0,290
theory.|

1550
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,390
0,395 395,710 710,965 965,1205 1205,1460
General relation that contains all

1551
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,030
0,350 460,765 765,1020 1020,1305 1305,1640
the that either appear on

1552
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,470
0,380 380,695 695,1030 1110,1510 1710,2000
the one relations or both

1553
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,820
0,165 165,440
the relations.|

1554
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,480
0,320 320,640
So here.|

1555
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,160
0,320
Look.|

1556
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,840
0,260 260,470 470,820
The union court.|

1557
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,390
0,290 290,530 530,755 755,935 935,1190
So union will get in,

1558
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,410
0,465 465,675 675,810 810,915 915,1020
sql, will get rid of

1559
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,355
0,120 120,540 540,750 750,855 855,945
the duplicates. If you want

1560
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,210
0,120 120,285 285,420 420,765 765,855
to keep the duplicates and

1561
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,800
0,75 75,165 165,300 300,590 1360,1590
make it run faster, you

1562
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,195
0,90 90,350 400,735 735,1035 1035,1395
would add its union all

1563
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:55,620
0,395
al.|

1564
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,470
0,335 335,530 530,620 620,710 710,830
We want to worry about

1565
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,420
0,260
that.|

1566
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,345
0,260 260,410 410,605 605,770 770,875
Just like you, we also

1567
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:01,980
0,90 90,545 775,1095 1095,1395 1395,1635
have intersection, same thing. We

1568
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,820
0,150 150,390 390,740 2230,2535 2535,2840
can take the take two

1569
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,340
0,400
and.|

1570
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,920
0,400
The.|

1571
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,020
0,260 260,380 380,640
At the pier.|

1572
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,880
0,275 275,515 515,860 860,1115 1115,1280
A difference is to take

1573
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,290
0,165 165,360 360,585 585,980 1090,1410
all the two installations and

1574
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,390
0,195 195,345 345,585 585,810 810,1100
spit out all ones that

1575
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,870
0,245 245,320 320,455 455,695 695,920
appear in the first one,

1576
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:21,820
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,630 630,950
but not the second one.|

1577
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,310
0,260 260,470 470,710 710,830 830,920
And it cool you would

1578
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,480
0,150 150,330 330,570 570,920
use this with the.|

1579
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,260
0,320 320,605 605,860 860,1055 1055,1220
This basic set theory, this

1580
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,355
0,120 120,380 430,705 705,915 915,1095
is not anything that should

1581
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,560
0,245 595,900 900,1205 1255,1655
be a surprising anyone.|

1582
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,375
0,245 245,350 350,515 515,695 695,815
So any questions before we

1583
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,090
0,90 90,330 330,725 1165,1440 1440,1715
move on to interesting things?|

1584
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,700
0,120 120,270 270,465 465,675 675,920
In this case, it's like.|

1585
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,540
0,245 245,365 365,590 590,940
Can you have different?|

1586
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,735
0,400 720,1100 1100,1385 1385,1690 2760,3005
Yeah. So question, is this

1587
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,450
0,245 625,870 870,1020 1020,1320 1320,1715
up? The question is, in

1588
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,280
0,290 290,500 500,725 725,920 920,1210
all these examples so far,

1589
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,775
0,260 260,425 425,710 710,995 995,1295
do the two input relations

1590
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:54,645
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,675 675,870
have to have the exact

1591
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,560
0,225 225,695 775,1175
same schema? Yes.|

1592
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,660
0,400
You.|

1593
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,420
0,400
Yes.|

1594
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,750
0,245 245,490 780,1180 1680,1955 1955,2230
All right. So the next,

1595
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,995
0,400 1440,1685 1685,1790 1790,1925 1925,2105
so if we start looking

1596
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:15,770
0,195 195,485 685,975 975,1395 1395,1775
at how to combine together

1597
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,645
0,305 305,610 1230,1630 1980,2330 2330,2555
the relations and potentially look

1598
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:19,380
0,135 135,375 375,510 510,615 615,735
at what's actually in the

1599
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,540
0,210 210,420 420,680
values of them.|

1600
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,945
0,245 245,335 335,455 455,605 605,725
So the first one we

1601
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,840
0,150 150,455 955,1230 1230,1500 1500,1895
do is the product operator.|

1602
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,850
0,260 260,410 410,650 695,755 755,860
Or in sql, it's called

1603
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,220
0,105 105,350
the chr.|

1604
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,990
0,305 305,500 500,650 650,830 830,1010
The idea here is that

1605
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,750
0,75 75,320 430,720 720,885 885,1670
you're basically going to concatenate

1606
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,120
0,400
the.|

1607
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,610
0,260 260,455 455,790 990,1235 1235,1480
The first relation and the.|

1608
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,040
0,400
People.|

1609
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,005
0,400 870,1220 1220,1505 1505,1610 1610,1835
Both. And it's for all

1610
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,820
0,315 315,905 925,1245 1245,1560 1560,1815
unique combinations of two from

1611
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,960
0,260 280,555 555,735 735,960 960,1140
the, from one relation and

1612
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,980
0,90 90,320 610,825 825,945 945,1020
the other. So you're starting

1613
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,520
0,90 90,165 165,270 270,390 390,540
to think this as like

1614
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,945
0,210 210,435 435,720 720,1010 1180,1425
two, four loops, right where

1615
00:51:46,945 --> 00:51:48,025
0,210 210,390 390,675 675,930 930,1080
there's four loops spinning over

1616
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:50,065
0,305 895,1200 1200,1485 1485,1815 1815,2040
r, every single in two

1617
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,115
0,105 105,195 195,455 685,990 990,1050
point and r, you're going

1618
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:52,450
0,245 355,840 840,960 960,1110 1110,1335
to catenate with every single

1619
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,760
0,180 180,270 270,345 345,590
two point and s.|

1620
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,880
0,225 225,470
And you?|

1621
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,695
0,290 290,425 425,500 500,620 620,815
I think, I guess why

1622
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,050
0,305 415,750 750,930 930,1065 1065,1355
this would actually be useful,

1623
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,370
0,260 260,410 410,575 575,740 740,1030
why we actually want this.|

1624
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,860
0,275 275,425 425,560 560,820
I can think of.|

1625
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,210
0,320 700,990 990,1125 1125,1260 1260,1350
Testing right if you're trying

1626
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,515
0,120 120,315 315,585 585,840 840,1305
to find all unique combinations

1627
00:52:24,515 --> 00:52:25,900
0,335 415,720 720,960 960,1095 1095,1385
of two inputs to test

1628
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,260
0,400 420,680 680,800 800,1025 1025,1280
some piece of software or

1629
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,760
0,290 1450,1850
some something.|

1630
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,400
0,350 350,560 560,680 680,845 845,1150
Then you could use this.|

1631
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,545
0,305 305,530 530,850 870,1130 1130,1235
But beyond that, as far

1632
00:52:35,545 --> 00:52:36,685
0,90 90,195 195,455 805,1050 1050,1140
as I know, this is

1633
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:37,500
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,585 585,815
not widely used at all.

1634
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,325
0,260 260,800 800,1085 1085,1295 1295,1505
And oftentimes this shows up

1635
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:40,375
0,165 165,345 345,510 510,750 750,1050
because you, you make mistake,

1636
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,185
0,180 180,375 375,555 555,660 660,810
like you forgot to wear

1637
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:42,070
0,270 270,495 495,630 630,735 735,885
claws and, and you get

1638
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,560
0,225 225,510 510,860
this by accident.|

1639
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,320
0,195 195,465 465,765 765,1160
Table at the table.|

1640
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,175
0,350 350,545 545,620 620,680 680,815
Or one of the people

1641
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:48,230
0,180 180,315 315,555 555,795 795,1055
says, what do you know?|

1642
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,580
0,230 230,290 290,335 335,550
What do you mean?|

1643
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,820
0,290
Like.|

1644
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,360
0,290 290,485 485,790 1320,1595 1595,1870
Of the table. Oh yeah,

1645
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,930
0,290 290,470 470,605 605,710 710,950
yeah. So same as like

1646
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,785
0,255 255,435 435,600 600,765 765,855
on table where they're trying

1647
00:52:57,785 --> 00:52:58,685
0,120 120,395 415,660 660,795 795,900
to like. But that's like

1648
00:52:58,685 --> 00:52:59,660
0,195 195,435 435,585 585,795 795,975
for inputs, right? They get

1649
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,620
0,260
all.|

1650
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,225
0,245 245,320 320,470 470,755 755,1055
Trying to get all possible

1651
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:04,150
0,455 985,1335 1335,1545 1545,1665 1665,1925
enums as input or something.|

1652
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,380
0,320 320,640
Super useful.|

1653
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,360
0,365 365,590 590,850 1380,1990
Is to do joints.|

1654
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,305
0,245 245,410 410,635 635,800 800,935
And the idea here is

1655
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:16,070
0,165 165,390 555,615 615,675 675,765
that when you're going to

1656
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,180
0,260
generate.|

1657
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,560
0,400 810,1355 1355,1550 1550,1810
The combinations of the.|

1658
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,160
0,335 335,530 530,725 725,965 965,1270
From the two input relations,

1659
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,730
0,290 290,515 515,740 740,1010 1010,1220
well SIM two for you

1660
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,220
0,210 210,465 465,525 525,950 1090,1490
know, it's a binary operator.

1661
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,000
0,260 260,520 750,1070 1070,1280 1280,1580
There are multi way joins.

1662
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,610
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,620 1090,1610
We can take multiple inputs,

1663
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,225
0,365 365,730 930,1190 1190,1340 1340,1505
multiple relations. We can ignore

1664
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:33,000
0,150 150,425 1165,1425 1425,1530 1530,1775
that from. You want to

1665
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,065
0,335 335,560 560,850 1110,1510 1590,1925
generate a new output that's

1666
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:36,715
0,75 75,180 180,455 985,1380 1380,1650
going to contain all the

1667
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,790
0,270 270,435 435,725 1195,1595 1675,2075
tubils that match on the

1668
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,160
0,245 245,880 1380,1835 1835,2075 2075,2350
the overlapping attributes in the

1669
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,510
0,695 695,1090 1260,1490 1490,1910 1910,2090
firstation and the overlapping attributes

1670
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,780
0,105 105,240 240,465 465,800
with the second relation.|

1671
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,520
0,400 480,880 900,1300 1320,1720
So different than the.|

1672
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,390
0,230 230,695 695,905 905,1265 1265,1460
The intersection, the intersection had

1673
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,540
0,105 105,210 210,345 345,620
to have the exact.|

1674
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,820
0,275 275,455 455,680 680,875 1040,1190
In this case here, I

1675
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,820
0,105 105,210 210,470
don't have to.|

1676
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,240
0,245 245,335 335,470 470,760 930,1310
I want to find the

1677
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,790
0,315 315,585 585,870 870,1035 1035,1550
attributes where they do overlap.

1678
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,120
0,400 720,1025 1025,1250 1250,1570
I gonna check that.|

1679
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
0,305 305,560 560,785 785,1060 1080,1370
And so in my in,

1680
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,250
0,255 255,480 480,645 645,870 870,1290
in the original relation algebra

1681
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,260
0,225 225,450 450,690 690,1070 1780,2010
here, you would actually, you

1682
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,805
0,315 315,615 615,795 795,1170 1170,1545
don't show the duplicate columns

1683
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:31,795
0,195 195,330 330,615 615,840 840,990
like the aid from r

1684
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:33,540
0,165 165,360 360,765 765,1115 1345,1745
and a aid from s.|

1685
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,135
0,260 260,410 410,470 470,560 560,725
So there's a bunch different

1686
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:42,440
0,305 595,870 870,1035 1035,1185 1185,1305
ways to write this in

1687
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,675
0,410 2560,2880 2880,3045 3045,3380 4810,5235
sql. There's a natural keyword

1688
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,260
0,195 195,605
in sql.|

1689
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,000
0,275 275,380 380,455 455,700
Or if you want.|

1690
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:45,940
0,400
Um.|

1691
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,320
0,260 260,395 395,590 590,860 860,1070
Ly like this. That's, that's

1692
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:49,920
0,150 150,315 315,435 435,525 525,600
a way to do it.

1693
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,155
0,560 1270,1605 1605,1695 1695,1935 1935,2235
It, it'll make your application

1694
00:55:52,155 --> 00:55:53,460
0,270 270,725
look brittle.|

1695
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,285
0,275 275,470 470,695 695,875 875,1055
The question is the order

1696
00:55:57,285 --> 00:55:58,335
0,165 165,555 555,780 780,930 930,1050
and rns matter in this

1697
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,780
0,275 775,1050 1050,1155 1155,1215 1215,1445
case, why would it matter?|

1698
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,590
0,225 225,375 375,495 495,600 600,750
I guess I was just

1699
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,930
0,240 240,450 450,710 760,1050 1050,1340
wondering what the output values.|

1700
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,610
0,260 280,675 675,930 930,1095 1095,1290
For example, in this case,

1701
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,000
0,210 210,1335 1335,1610 1630,2010 2010,2390
there's onlyaneous values for s.|

1702
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,750
0,135 135,330 330,555 555,830 1090,1350
So then, with the output.|

1703
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,240
0,400
Yeah.|

1704
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,660
0,400 630,890 890,1040 1040,1330
Again at this point.|

1705
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,380
0,305 305,610 690,1010 1010,1330
A single natural Joy.|

1706
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,640
0,275 275,380 380,610 750,1150
Both of them, yes.|

1707
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,540
0,400
Yes.|

1708
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,240
0,260 260,410 410,605 605,910
So his question is.|

1709
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,500
0,550
Projection.|

1710
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,050
0,400 780,1055 1055,1160 1160,1390 1590,1910
So these are the ones

1711
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,475
0,210 210,500 730,1095 1095,1305 1305,1425
that, that or the ones

1712
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:05,985
0,150 150,270 270,345 345,420 420,510
I showed you with the

1713
00:59:05,985 --> 00:59:08,310
0,390 390,555 555,765 765,1085 2065,2325
fundamentals that ted defined in

1714
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,840
0,105 105,240 240,1110 1110,1320 1320,1530
the late 97, it got

1715
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,485
0,240 240,375 375,450 450,525 525,645
extended with a bunch of

1716
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:11,740
0,225 225,575
additional things.|

1717
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,070
0,350 350,650 650,1000 1020,1325 1325,1630
Building real applications you need

1718
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,960
0,350 350,700
more than.|

1719
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:18,240
0,245 245,320 320,380 380,530 530,830
Here in the original relational

1720
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,790
0,270 270,570 570,1070 1420,1820 1900,2550
model, relational algebra, right renaming

1721
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,880
0,320 580,840 840,990 990,1460
is like a projection.|

1722
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,820
0,605 605,1000 1080,1340 1340,1475 1475,1840
Assigning values or starting assigning

1723
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,480
0,380 380,700 2040,2440 2610,3010
attributes to, to, to.|

1724
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:33,310
0,400 1080,1690 1770,2350 2610,2915 2915,3520
Important duplicate elimination distinct clauses.|

1725
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,980
0,400
That.|

1726
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,400
0,400
I.|

1727
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,540
0,395 395,790
On count.|

1728
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,385
0,290 290,455 455,620 620,785 785,905
Used to teach it. We

1729
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:55,750
0,165 165,360 360,600 600,905 1105,1365
don't teach anymore because you

0,165 165,345 345,620 940,1260 1260,1490
never find it. It's basically

1731
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,410
0,365 365,755 755,800 800,890 890,1150
wait division's a way to.|

1732

0,400 2340,2615 2615,2750 2750,2915 2915,3155
Find find the two one

1733
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:04,200
0,270 270,605 655,960 960,1245 1245,1605
run relation that matches all

1734
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,940
0,315 315,465 465,675 675,980
tubes in another relation.|

1735
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,405
0,260 260,515 515,620 620,680 680,755
It doesn't appear in the

1736
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,325
0,120 120,395 1135,1455 1455,1620 1620,1920
real war, it's not common.

1737
01:00:10,325 --> 01:00:10,925
0,195 195,330 330,420 420,495 495,600
We don't have to worry

1738
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:13,840
0,120 120,365 685,1085 1285,1685
about it the again.|

1739
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,250
0,305 305,575 575,800 800,965 965,1220
The core of every relational

1740
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,135
0,195 195,390 390,540 540,690 690,885
data system would be built

1741
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:17,275
0,300 300,585 585,765 765,945 945,1140
on, on these, on these,

1742
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:18,790
0,180 180,315 315,815 1135,1395 1395,1515
on this algebra, and then

1743
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,200
0,105 105,285 285,620 1030,1430
we can define a.|

1744
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,440
0,400 870,1175 1175,1325 1325,1570
Around the sort of.|

1745
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,260
0,260 260,380 380,515 515,790 900,1300
That allow us to support

1746
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,340
0,365 365,815 815,1130 1130,1510 1650,2000
very expressive, very complex sql

01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,360
0,380
queries.|

1748
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,460
0,400
Question.|

1749
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,210
0,260 260,365 365,440 440,500 500,730
So why do we need?|

1750
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,270
0,245 245,335 335,515 515,770 770,950
Because you can find a

1751
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,890
0,105 105,255 255,675 675,1040 1360,1620
look at elimination on the

01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,260
0,210 210,560
primary key.|

1753
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,960
0,400
So.|

1754
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,000
0,400
The.|

1755
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,780
0,400
Fr.|

1756
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,900
0,400
I.|

1757
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,220
0,430
Query.|

1758
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,960
0,400
Still.|

1759
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,590
0,245 245,490 810,1070 1070,1205 1205,1480
You know, piece of software,

1760
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,085
0,290 290,515 515,770 770,1085 1085,1325
the system to actually execute

1761
01:01:06,085 --> 01:01:06,800
0,245
it.|

1762
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,620
0,400
Very.|

1763
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,040
0,400 720,1010 1010,1220 1220,1535 1535,1930
So one order versus another.|

1764
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,800
0,290 290,500 500,815 815,1210
So say I do.|

1765
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,840
0,400 930,1235 1235,1535 1535,1870 1890,2560
Where? Where? There the sb.|

1766
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,300
0,2660 2660,2855 2855,3160 3360,3760 5070,5360
2,000,000,002 poles together, billion, one

1767
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,645
0,290 880,1155 1155,1430 1930,2330 3040,3345
billion, two pol together right

1768
01:02:00,645 --> 01:02:01,640
0,305
away.|

1769
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,680
0,320
Right.|

1770
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,180
0,395 395,695 695,890 890,1025 1025,1460
So out you show specifying

1771
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,155
0,300 300,570 570,720 720,855 855,975
basically how you want the

1772
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:06,150
0,150 150,315 315,510 510,720 720,995
data system to execute things.|

1773
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,805
0,230 230,365 365,670 690,1090 1350,1595
So a better approach, and

1774
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:10,140
0,105 105,210 210,605
this is motivation.|

1775
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,920
0,245 245,365 365,485 485,575 575,710
Is that we want to

1776
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,770
0,290 700,960 960,1155 1155,1490 2440,2850
tell the database system. Here's

1777
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,340
0,105 105,300 300,540 540,830
the answer we want.|

1778
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,240
0,135 135,375 375,510 510,735 735,900
We don't know how, we

1779
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,320
0,210 210,435 435,660 660,930 930,1080
don't care how you're actually

1780
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,310
0,90 90,320 460,750 750,885 885,990
going to us, but this

1781
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:18,865
0,105 105,195 195,300 300,435 435,555
is what we want you

1782
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:20,100
0,90 90,225 225,345 345,575
to do for us.|

1783
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,735
0,260 260,500 500,950 950,1115 1115,1295
Instead of specifying the exact

1784
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:22,935
0,480 480,675 675,825 825,975 975,1200
algebra steps, I want the

1785
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:23,840
0,335
computer.|

1786
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,855
0,400 690,1205 1205,1310 1310,1430 1430,1775
Hey, retrieve the two poles

1787
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:27,500
0,330 330,935
from Rs.|

1788
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,235
0,305 305,515 515,665 665,800 800,1085
And find me all those

1789
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:30,860
0,375 375,755
where b.|

1790
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,975
0,245 245,365 365,620 620,830 830,995
And then now the data

1791
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:34,460
0,315 315,630 630,965 985,1260 1260,1485
system can can take into

1792
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,780
0,350 550,855 855,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320
account how the data is

1793
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,790
0,180 180,465 465,660 660,765 765,1010
being stored, what kind of.|

1794
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,980
0,320 320,530 530,740 740,920 920,1180
Where things are actually physically

1795
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,060
0,400
located.|

1796
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,845
0,260 730,1005 1005,1170 1170,1545 1545,1785
Ah, what the cpu can

1797
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,840
0,365 565,840 840,960 960,1205 1555,1995
support. What kind of cpu

1798
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,530
0,105 105,225 225,450 450,630 630,690
do I have? Do I

1799
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,235
0,60 60,150 150,540 540,645 645,705
have a gpu? Do have

1800
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:46,075
0,75 75,540 540,720 720,765 765,840
an fpga? Do I have

1801
01:02:46,075 --> 01:02:47,640
0,165 165,485 835,1140 1140,1305 1305,1565
other things? All of that.|

1802
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:50,940
0,290 290,580
Can be.|

1803
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,400
0,260 260,485 485,815 815,1070 1070,1360
In its decision for how

1804
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:53,745
0,320 320,515 515,620 620,860 860,1115
to execute the query one

1805
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:55,080
0,150 150,420 420,815
way versus another.|

1806
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,465
0,400 630,965 965,1175 1175,1325 1325,1535
Now, again, think of like

1807
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:58,545
0,195 195,390 390,510 510,810 810,1080
if I'm a developer, I

1808
01:02:58,545 --> 01:02:59,355
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,690 690,810
can write a bunch of

1809
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:00,390
0,150 150,255 255,360 360,795 795,1035
code in my laptop, writes

1810
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,635
0,210 210,680 700,945 945,1065 1065,1245
some sql or my little

1811
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:03,585
0,195 195,485 1345,1620 1620,1770 1770,1950
test database, and then the

1812
01:03:03,585 --> 01:03:04,980
0,300 300,705 705,960 960,1200 1200,1395
same sql statement will then

1813
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,590
0,270 270,540 540,735 735,1010 1210,1610
work exactly the same. Or

1814
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,860
0,305 305,605 605,860 860,980 980,1160
it also produce the same

1815
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,585
0,270 270,620 1150,1395 1395,1560 1560,1725
correct result when I deploy

1816
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,030
0,150 150,455 505,905 955,1200 1200,1445
in production on, you know,

1817
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,150
0,275 275,545 545,815 815,935 935,1040
a giant machine that has

1818
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,960
0,90 90,320 640,885 885,1130
a lot of memory.|

1819
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:14,770
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,450 450,570
And I don't have to

1820
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,480
0,150 150,405 405,705 705,1040
change my application code.|

1821
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,420
0,245 245,470 470,590 590,850 960,1250
So that's the beauty. That's

1822
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,290
0,75 75,300 300,555 555,705 705,870
the beauty of why you're

1823
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:19,860
0,45 45,105 105,195 195,285 285,570
going to want to declare

1824
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,650
0,320 1000,1380 1380,1760 2140,2490 2490,2790
language. But the, the core

1825
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,705
0,300 300,525 525,690 690,980 1570,2055
concept of how that declarative

1826
01:03:24,705 --> 01:03:25,460
0,180 180,360 360,435 435,510 510,755
language are going to work

1827
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:27,195
0,275 275,440 440,860 860,1210 1290,1625
is me predicated on later

1828
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:28,180
0,545
algebra.|

1829
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,945
0,400 840,1310 1310,1430 1430,1520 1520,1595
So sql is going to

1830
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:33,740
0,90 90,165 165,240 240,555 555,795
be the de facto standard,

1831
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,280
0,350 370,720 720,1010
as we discuss.|

1832
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,360
0,400
Okay.|

1833
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,145
0,290 290,485 485,650 650,845 845,1025
Quick. Before we go, I

1834
01:03:55,145 --> 01:03:55,655
0,75 75,135 135,225 225,345 345,510
want to talk about other

1835
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:59,000
0,180 180,455
data models.|

1836
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,790
0,395 395,790 1050,1385 1385,1640 1640,1850
And because vector database is

1837
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,510
0,105 105,240 240,390 390,495 495,720
the hot thing on hacker

1838
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,860
0,210 210,465 465,675 675,1040 1090,1350
news, it's worth discussing what

1839
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,985
0,165 165,315 315,560 850,1065 1065,1125
they actually are. So you

1840
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:17,825
0,225 225,495 495,630 630,750 750,840
guys understand why it's all

1841
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:18,830
0,455 505,780 780,885 885,945 945,1005
bullshit. You see it in

1842
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,800
0,75 75,195 195,470
the real world.|

1843
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,635
0,335 335,590 590,815 815,1120 1140,1445
So document data model is

1844
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:25,800
0,305 985,1275 1275,1770 1770,1905 1905,2165
old. So mongodb came out

1845
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,135
0,730 1080,1385 1385,1580 1580,2075 2075,2225
2008 all this groundbreaking. We're

1846
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:29,935
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,995 1405,1800
storing things as json, but

1847
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:31,135
0,330 330,585 585,795 795,1020 1020,1200
the ideas go back to

1848
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:33,295
0,90 90,525 525,815 1405,1725 1725,2160
the 1980 s early 1990

1849
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:34,920
0,165 165,300 300,545 655,1055
s they were object.|

1850
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:35,955
0,260 260,455 455,725 725,920 920,1025
Object ori programming was the

1851
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,515
0,210 210,575 955,1200 1200,1365 1365,1560
high thing. So people said

1852
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:38,325
0,150 150,285 285,465 465,630 630,810
rather than storing things of

1853
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:39,360
0,305 415,675 675,765 765,870 870,1035
relations, we want to store

1854
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,565
0,210 210,530 640,1005 1005,1370 1960,2205
things as as objects. And

1855
01:04:41,565 --> 01:04:42,255
0,105 105,225 225,375 375,555 555,690
then they had these sort

1856
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:43,695
0,210 210,630 630,870 870,1185 1185,1440
of specialized programming languages that

1857
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:45,540
0,150 150,255 255,360 360,635 1525,1845
knew how to write, write

1858
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,900
0,320 880,1140 1140,1400 1540,1940 1960,2360
code in your like in.|

1859
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,420
0,260 260,520
It would.|

1860
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,740
0,350 350,700
Database system.|

1861
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,585
0,245 245,490 840,1130 1130,1360 1470,1805
But those they're basically those

1862
01:04:55,585 --> 01:04:56,230
0,180 180,270 270,375 375,510 510,645
objects are the same thing

1863
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,685
0,135 135,590 910,1230 1230,1320 1320,1455
as json they're the same

1864
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,005
0,120 120,210 210,555 555,900 900,1320
thing as xl. Xl databases

1865
01:04:59,005 --> 01:04:59,560
0,120 120,195 195,315 315,465 465,555
were the hot thing in

1866
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,450
0,60 60,165 165,1100 1330,1650 1650,1890
the late 90,000, so a

1867
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:02,820
0,210 210,390 390,680 760,1065 1065,1370
high level alt are equivalent.|

1868
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,080
0,400 630,1030
So that.|

1869
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,570
0,270 270,360 360,830 880,1215 1215,1550
It's a hierarchical data structure.

1870
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,190
0,290 290,485 485,695 695,965 965,1330
We have these named fields,

1871
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:11,745
0,305 305,485 485,755 755,1010 1010,1115
and the values of the

1872
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:15,255
0,180 180,515 2575,2835 2835,3095 3205,3510
named fields can be an

1873
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:16,960
0,240 240,450 450,750 750,1025
array, a scalar type.|

1874
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,920
0,275 275,550
And that.|

1875
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,295
0,260 260,470 470,725 725,875 875,1055
And again, all the monitor

1876
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:22,215
0,300 300,665 685,975 975,1445 1675,1920
systems use use json. So

1877
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:23,295
0,105 105,225 225,450 450,750 750,1080
now the reason why these,

1878
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:25,460
0,395 925,1200 1200,1395 1395,1715 1765,2165
these document database systems exist

1879
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,965
0,305 305,610 1530,1930 2460,2780 2780,3095
is this this problem that

1880
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:31,215
0,270 270,435 435,615 615,905 1705,2250
comes up called the impedance

1881
01:05:31,215 --> 01:05:32,380
0,455
mismatch.|

1882
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,930
0,500 500,800 800,890 890,1070 1070,1390
That's, that's the problem of

1883
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,940
0,305 305,530 530,800 800,1150 1410,1810
if I break my, my,

1884
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,030
0,320 320,590 590,815 815,935 935,1070
my data up into these

1885
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,220
0,225 225,560 1360,1740 1740,2010 2010,2190
different relations. But I write

1886
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,870
0,290 490,855 855,1185 1185,1440 1440,1650
my application code in like

1887
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,450
0,435 435,645 645,950 1000,1290 1290,1580
python or whatever in in

1888
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,515
0,400 1080,1445 1445,1670 1670,1820 1820,2015
objects. Now when I want

1889
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:45,625
0,180 180,345 345,780 780,960 960,1110
to go retrieve data from

1890
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,370
0,225 225,605 775,1035 1035,1200 1200,1745
the it bunch of joins

1891
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,720
0,395 395,760 1380,1780
stitch together my.|

1892
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,545
0,300 300,480 480,630 630,750 750,825
Is the form that I

1893
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:51,460
0,105 105,300 300,540 540,705 705,915
want to operate on my

1894
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,520
0,350 730,1130 1270,1530 1530,1725 1725,2060
application but the database wants?|

1895
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,020
0,290 290,580
Or separate.|

1896
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,760
0,275 275,515 515,880
And so the.|

1897
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:06,650
0,260 260,365 365,530 530,695 695,860
And I would argue, yeah,

1898
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,865
0,180 180,345 345,650 790,1065 1065,1215
for some things that makes

1899
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:09,500
0,275 745,1050 1050,1200 1200,1365 1365,1635
sense. But for other things,

1900
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,595
0,360 360,510 510,585 585,780 780,1095
it's actually a bad idea

1901
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:11,780
0,365 655,915 915,1050 1050,1110 1110,1185
because now you're gonna have

1902
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,700
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,660 660,920
a bunch of duplicate data.

1903
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:13,670
0,230 230,305 305,440 440,590 590,740
You have all the problems

1904
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,645
0,165 165,330 330,560 580,855 855,975
we solved before where I

1905
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:15,520
0,90 90,165 165,315 315,555 555,875
got to make sure that

1906
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,450
0,245 245,410 410,730 780,1070 1070,1250
if I change, change, something

1907
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,700
0,210 210,645 645,855 855,975 975,1250
that's duplicated in a file

1908
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,960
0,380 380,620 620,880 1080,1340 1340,1460
in my database, I make

1909
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,725
0,120 120,300 300,495 495,645 645,765
the changes all over the

1910
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:22,640
0,245
place.|

1911
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,690
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,665 665,800
So we go back to

1912
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,170
0,135 135,360 360,680 1780,2130 2130,2480
our example before of the.|

1913
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,680
0,290 290,455 455,730
So the high.|

1914
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,070
0,275 275,410 410,515 515,760 780,1040
If I have an object,

1915
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,210
0,150 150,375 375,710 820,1050 1050,1140
I once again for a

1916
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,215
0,180 180,480 480,780 780,885 885,1005
given artist, here's all the

1917
01:06:40,215 --> 01:06:41,930
0,375 375,755 925,1230 1230,1425 1425,1715
albums that they appear on.|

1918
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,080
0,400
Right.|

1919
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,905
0,195 195,315 315,435 435,615 615,825
Now, you can do this

1920
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,450
0,165 165,425 715,1035 1035,1350 1350,1545
in a single sql statement,

1921
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,600
0,180 180,440
but yeah.|

1922
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:57,180
0,105 105,285 285,585 585,965
It's not perfect, but.|

1923
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:00,290
0,520 1230,1565 1565,1810 1980,2240 2240,2500
It's, there's ways on it.

1924
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,115
0,350 350,700 810,1070 1070,1310 1310,1505
So the document deities, people

1925
01:07:02,115 --> 01:07:03,195
0,285 285,495 495,720 720,870 870,1080
say you don't need this

1926
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:05,600
0,225 225,545 865,1125 1125,1385 2005,2405
guy here of this and

1927
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,580
0,260 260,500 500,860 860,1235 1235,1630
if your application code is.|

1928
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,100
0,400
Table.|

1929
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:28,395
0,275 275,455 455,620 620,755 755,1025
And same problem as before.

1930
01:07:28,395 --> 01:07:31,590
0,395 595,945 945,1295 1975,2375 2815,3195
Like if I if artists

1931
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,390
0,270 270,345 345,435 435,540 540,800
appearing on the same album,

1932
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,885
0,275 275,395 395,530 530,875 875,1145
I could have duplicate entries

1933
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:35,060
0,120 120,255 255,420 420,810 810,1175
in all their json documents.

1934
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,060
0,230 230,305 305,425 425,620 620,830
And if I make updates,

1935
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:36,705
0,150 150,255 255,330 330,435 435,645
gotta make sure I change,

1936
01:07:36,705 --> 01:07:38,000
0,195 195,330 330,450 450,695
change all of them.|

1937
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,840
0,400
So.|

1938
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:50,560
0,305 305,610 780,1480
And so, natively.|

1939
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,740
0,400 870,1270
So the.|

1940
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,525
0,245 245,605 605,920 920,1145 1145,1265
Interesting inflection point in the

1941
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:02,080
0,245 685,1085 1225,1625
database marketplace. Where?|

1942
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,710
0,275 275,545 545,845 845,1130 1130,1370
Almost all the, the, the

1943
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:04,955
0,345 345,810 810,945 945,1110 1110,1245
json databases that said we

1944
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:05,615
0,120 120,165 165,240 240,375 375,660
don't want to use sql,

1945
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:05,990
0,75 75,180 180,225 225,285 285,375
we don't want to use

1946
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,580
0,210 210,435 435,740 1120,1410 1410,1590
relational data model. A lot

1947
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,960
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,590 790,1380
of them have basically converged

1948
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,630
0,300 300,570 570,795 795,1220 1270,1670
and become more relational like.|

1949
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,130
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,680 680,860
And you can run. You

1950
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,470
0,75 75,240 240,630 630,920 940,1340
can write sql on j.|

1951
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,810
0,275 275,550 810,1175 1175,1540 2190,2480
And so over time, what

1952
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,670
0,255 255,375 375,465 465,585 585,860
we're seeing is that the

1953
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,580
0,400 600,1000 1050,1450 1980,2255 2255,2530
intellectual difference between document data,

1954
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,770
0,335 335,880 930,1190 1190,1460 1460,2110
sql databases, and relational databases

1955
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,720
0,365 365,635 635,970 1380,1640 1640,1820
has, has shrunk. And now

1956
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,420
0,320 615,675 675,795 795,1065 1065,1700
basically they're all relational databases.|

1957
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,500
0,470 470,575 575,650 650,800 800,1160
Mongo was the last holdout.

1958
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,700
0,345 345,555 555,780 780,930 930,1200
Mongo added support for sequel

1959
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,370
0,150 150,1160 1510,1910 2260,2535 2535,2670
in 2021 right, but for

1960
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:36,510
0,260 580,825 825,930 930,1035 1035,1140
years because we know the

1961
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,245
0,285 285,390 390,465 465,585 585,735
founders are like, oh, we're

1962
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:38,060
0,75 75,165 165,255 255,390 390,815
never going to support sequel,

1963
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,340
0,275 275,550
they do.|

1964
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,480
0,290 290,455 455,730
And then get.|

1965
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,840
0,260 260,520 660,935 935,1390
They also support json.|

1966
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,890
0,215 215,430 900,1205 1205,1445 1445,1780
So I go to a.|

1967
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,870
0,240 240,590 670,1070 1330,1695 1695,2190
Document database that is contorting

1968
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:49,815
0,105 105,330 330,570 570,735 735,945
and stuff look like relational

1969
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,350
0,285 285,510 510,600 600,845 1135,1535
database when you just database.|

1970
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,360
0,380
Post.|

1971
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,980
0,400
Oh.|

1972
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,350
0,320 320,395 395,485 485,730 780,1180
They're in the news because

1973
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,665
0,380 380,650 650,905 905,1055 1055,1145
obviously chat gb is the

1974
01:09:00,665 --> 01:09:02,800
0,150 150,455 775,1065 1065,1355 1735,2135
hot thing. And so the.|

1975
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,080
0,260 260,410 410,545 545,680 680,830
The way to think about

1976
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,180
0,165 165,360 360,495 495,720 720,1100
this now is like the.|

1977
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,770
0,350 350,575 575,850 870,1235 1235,1600
In when pure web applications

1978
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,045
0,470 470,710 710,1030 1320,1580 1580,1745
1015 years ago, everything was

1979
01:09:11,045 --> 01:09:13,565
0,210 210,725 2095,2325 2325,2415 2415,2520
always json. Therefore, I need

1980
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:14,660
0,105 105,420 420,695 715,945 945,1095
a json database and that's

1981
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,425
0,105 105,225 225,345 345,570 570,765
how the new sql systems

1982
01:09:15,425 --> 01:09:17,090
0,210 210,485 895,1200 1200,1425 1425,1665
got started. Now it's like,

1983
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:17,825
0,255 255,375 375,480 480,600 600,735
OK, well I have all

1984
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:19,580
0,195 195,515 535,935 1135,1440 1440,1755
this, this, these these vectors

1985
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,740
0,255 255,540 540,890 1060,1460 1930,2160
I'm back from from from

1986
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,360
0,210 210,1140 1140,1305 1305,1470 1470,1620
my formergbt or whatever I'm

1987
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,280
0,230
using.|

1988
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,195
0,260 260,395 395,530 530,635 635,845
Store that in a database

1989
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:26,580
0,225 225,375 375,765 765,930 930,1385
that can natively store vectors,

1990
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,800
0,230 230,320 320,440 440,700
so I can do.|

1991
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:31,685
0,335 335,545 545,755 755,935 935,1055
And I would argue that

1992
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:34,060
0,165 165,455 745,1145
these systems they.|

1993
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,530
0,425 425,880 930,1295 1295,1520 1520,2090
They're, they're limited the functionality

1994
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,390
0,60 60,210 210,450 450,645 645,860
and over time they're basically

1995
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,720
0,245 245,335 335,455 455,605 605,980
going to have to morph

1996
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,595
0,270 270,465 465,720 720,1010 1600,1875
to a validation database. So

1997
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:42,410
0,150 150,375 375,570 570,875 1465,1815
the vector data model vector

1998
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,860
0,180 180,330 330,620
is just a.|

1999
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,900
0,320
Red.|

2000
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,660
0,225 225,530 580,980 1090,1425 1425,1760
That and in in this

2001
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:49,025
0,320 320,515 515,790 1620,1925 1925,2135
approach here with case, it's

2002
01:09:49,025 --> 01:09:50,110
0,75 75,225 225,585 585,765 765,1085
a one dimensional array of

2003
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,940
0,380 380,515 515,790
floating point numbers.|

2004
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,760
0,400 990,1295 1295,1565 1565,1930
And the system going.|

2005
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,310
0,335 335,575 575,845 845,1130 1130,1450
Neighbor search either exact or

2006
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,865
0,640 810,1070 1070,1205 1205,1325 1325,1445
approximate to allow you to

2007
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:00,250
0,435 435,675 675,930 930,1110 1110,1385
semantic search over your data.

2008
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:01,805
0,230 230,290 290,410 410,590 590,935
So in all my predates

2009
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:02,660
0,120 120,255 255,465 465,735 735,855
I showed before, it's like

2010
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:04,895
0,270 270,570 570,795 1405,1800 1800,2070
AI equals two, AI equals

2011
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:05,990
0,135 135,255 255,435 435,755 775,1095
one, o two whatever the

2012
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,380
0,225 225,530
exact matches.|

2013
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,840
0,275 275,470 470,905 905,1145 1145,1340
But these vectors allow you

2014
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,360
0,290 700,1100 1210,1610 1630,2250 2250,2520
to embed somehow magically through,

2015
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,300
0,380 580,960 960,1490 2410,2700 2700,2940
through, through transformers, a deeper

2016
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,275
0,285 285,480 480,630 630,765 765,975
meaning of what your data

2017
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:17,235
0,255 255,465 465,735 735,900 900,960
actually looks like. So you

2018
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:18,315
0,105 105,330 330,600 600,810 810,1080
can ask higher level questions

2019
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,980
0,365 445,845 955,1230 1230,1470 1470,1665
like, hey, show me, you

2020
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,165
0,230 370,615 615,720 720,930 930,1185
know, show me things related

2021
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:23,700
0,180 180,455 1225,1530 1530,1835
to this you show.|

2022
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,780
0,230 230,320 320,515 515,770 770,1070
Instead of doing exact matches

2023
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,460
0,225 225,330 330,615 615,1130 1420,1680
for the keyboard, cmu I

2024
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,390
0,225 225,435 435,600 600,780 780,930
would I would, I can

2025
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,540
0,210 210,435 435,740 820,1220
learn things like, oh.|

2026
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,125
0,320 320,500 500,740 740,1120 1140,1445
Talk about a university in

2027
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:38,315
0,225 225,875 1615,1875 1875,2025 2025,2190
in Pittsburgh that was fan

2028
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:39,420
0,120 120,365
of by.|

2029
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,215
0,400 750,1025 1025,1205 1205,1505 1505,1895
Like you can learn things

2030
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:44,300
0,395 1195,1455 1455,1545 1545,1965 1965,2085
about that are implicit in

2031
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,590
0,135 135,410 640,900 900,1035 1035,1290
the data rather than doing

2032
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,960
0,285 285,680
exact lookup.|

2033
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,300
0,400
Yes.|

2034
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,400
0,260 260,425 425,590 590,845 845,1040
The question is what's interesting,

2035
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,010
0,195 195,645 645,840 840,1065 1065,1610
graph databases and vector databases,

2036
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,120
0,335 335,440 440,560 560,650 650,1030
let's take that one offline.

2037
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,470
0,335 335,580 660,1060 1650,2075 2075,2270
That's different, but vectors literally

2038
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:59,180
0,240 240,480 480,800 1060,1440 1440,1710
just a one like one

2039
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,235
0,375 375,830 1180,1500 1500,1965 1965,2055
dimensional arrays. Graph databases are

2040
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:02,555
0,180 180,360 360,665 715,1080 1080,1320
storing the relationship between objects

2041
01:11:02,555 --> 01:11:03,560
0,135 135,450 450,585 585,885 885,1005
like edges and nodes and

2042
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,065
0,120 120,255 255,1460 1480,1880 2200,2505
things like that one from

2043
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:06,480
0,305
the.|

2044
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,220
0,195 195,435 435,720 720,1170 1170,1520
It sounds like it's similar.|

2045
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,395
0,290 290,410 410,545 545,650 650,815
Minutes. If you're looking at

2046
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:11,250
0,195 195,390 390,525 525,660 660,855
one degree from the current

2047
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,060
0,300 300,390 390,510 510,615 615,810
node, it sounds like it's

2048
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,620
0,260 580,980
similar, but.|

2049
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,845
0,260 260,410 410,700 1500,1745 1745,1835
But like the how to

2050
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:18,060
0,105 105,365
say this.|

2051
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,635
0,245 245,365 365,560 560,880 1080,1505
In a graph database, you're

2052
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:22,680
0,405 405,755 1165,1565 1855,2255 2755,3045
explicitly storing that structure and

2053
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,760
0,225 225,630 630,720 720,870 870,1080
you're traversing it to find

2054
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,710
0,195 195,315 315,465 465,615 615,950
things that you're looking for.

2055
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,475
0,275 275,425 425,700 930,1250 1250,1565
This is like I'm encoding

2056
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:27,285
0,75 75,195 195,360 360,615 615,810
it as a vector and

2057
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:28,035
0,105 105,285 285,420 420,600 600,750
I don't know what the

2058
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,040
0,210 210,435 435,755 805,1565
vector is actually representing.|

2059
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,640
0,400 450,755 755,1180 1380,1780 1950,2210
So pine cones, one a

2060
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,020
0,135 135,410
bunch of.|

2061
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:39,890
0,245 245,335 335,440 440,545 545,680
Gave a talk with us

2062
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,180
0,150 150,300 300,590
two years ago.|

2063
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,205
0,180 180,285 285,510 510,795 795,945
In two weeks, so if

2064
01:11:48,205 --> 01:11:48,595
0,75 75,135 135,195 195,285 285,390
you want to learn more

2065
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:49,680
0,90 90,335 535,780 780,855 855,1085
about this, check it out.|

2066
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:51,680
0,290 290,515 515,815 815,1085 1085,1250
At their core, all these

2067
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,820
0,195 195,645 645,810 810,1005 1005,1140
vector databases are just going

2068
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,360
0,90 90,330 330,710
to be a.|

2069
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,645
0,290 290,440 440,590 590,740 740,935
Index, a lot to do,

2070
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,020
0,255 255,495 495,815
nearest neighbor search.|

2071
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,790
0,350 350,700 990,1220 1220,1295 1295,1400
Right, so sort of looks

2072
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:00,980
0,120 120,380
like this.|

2073
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,750
0,350 350,700 1290,1640 1640,1880 1880,2170
Interpret these things right. It

2074
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,085
0,400 1020,1280 1280,1505 1505,1870 1890,2135
numbers the need never it

2075
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:31,685
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,495 495,600
out. We don't know what

2076
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:32,680
0,90 90,335
it is.|

2077
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:15,810
0,400 690,965 965,1115 1115,1295 1295,1600
As my rank order list.|

2078
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,180
0,135 135,315 315,620 730,975 975,1110
That's the core at a

2079
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,050
0,180 180,345 345,510 510,690 690,870
super high level of what

2080
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,090
0,165 165,405 405,615 615,765 765,1040
a vector device is doing.|

2081
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,645
0,290 290,455 455,620 620,815 815,935
Question. Is this similar to

2082
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:30,115
0,210 210,660 660,870 870,1145 1165,1470
relational calculus? What is what

2083
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:31,300
0,150 150,240 240,485
part of this?|

2084
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,120
0,400
Well.|

2085
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,040
0,400 420,820
Or we.|

2086
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,500
0,365 365,500 500,665 665,940 1170,1570
I'm just trying to them.|

2087
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,000
0,350 350,590 590,880
They care about.|

2088
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,880
0,245 245,365 365,560 560,880
So I would argue.|

2089
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,385
0,290 290,580 900,1300 1590,1925 1925,2165
The core these are is

2090
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:33,520
0,240 240,575
just this.|

2091
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,980
0,400
No.|

2092
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,315
0,320 320,500 500,635 635,910 1080,1325
Right, you can do a

2093
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:56,425
0,90 90,315 315,795 795,915 915,1110
bunch of databases. They all

2094
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,700
0,255 255,575
added this.|

2095
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,905
0,380 380,755 755,1000 1470,1820 1820,2135
Has pg better single store

2096
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:02,040
0,485
clickhouse.|

2097
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:06,900
0,400 540,940 1590,1990 2070,2470
Beyond all for now.|

2098
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,000
0,400
Okay.|

2099
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,580
0,230 230,320 320,410 410,455 455,770
I just want to expose

2100
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,640
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,800
to you to see.|

2101
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,260
0,575 575,680 680,1240 2340,2585 2585,2660
Databases are ubiquitous is going

2102
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,740
0,90 90,270 270,465 465,920
to find the primitive.|

2103
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,175
0,335 335,670 1500,1790 1790,2015 2015,2345
Database system and then relational

2104
01:15:21,175 --> 01:15:22,105
0,330 330,405 405,525 525,690 690,930
algabra will be the the

2105
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:23,480
0,335
core.|

2106
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,815
0,275 275,485 485,1000 1290,1550 1550,1715
Do these interactions and then

2107
01:15:25,815 --> 01:15:27,000
0,390 390,630 630,870 870,1065 1065,1185
that'll define how we want

2108
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,005
0,105 105,360 360,660 660,885 885,1005
to build the component of

2109
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:29,505
0,105 105,395 685,1035 1035,1305 1305,1500
our system to, to, to

2110
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:32,640
0,180 180,665 2185,2460 2460,2910 2910,3135
run queries. So wednesday's class

2111
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,340
0,210 210,435 435,800 1060,1380 1380,1700
will be on on c,

2112
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,720
0,380 380,710 710,935 935,1210 1680,2000
project zero is out. Please

01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,635
0,195 195,330 330,525 525,795 795,915
start it now. It's due

2114
01:15:37,635 --> 01:15:39,495
0,165 165,695 1255,1515 1515,1635 1635,1860
the eleventh and then homework

01:15:39,495 --> 01:15:40,700
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,695
one will be out.|
