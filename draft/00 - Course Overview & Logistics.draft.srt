0,105 105,710 850,1215 1215,1580 1630,1905
of databases right. And this

23
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:00,570
0,135 135,240 240,360 360,510 510,675

bad things happen so for

29
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:09,555
0,275 475,875 925,1260 1260,1470 1470,1650
me the the two most

30
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:10,520
0,195 195,345 345,465 465,645 645,965
important things in my life.|

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,345
0,300 300,570 570,860 940,1245 1245,1425
Are my wife and my

biological daughter first their number

33
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,570
0,305 595,855 855,1005 1005,1230 1230,1455
one, and then after that

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,745
0,240 240,980 1120,1530 1530,1820 1930,2175
is databases? That's really, you

35
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,500
0,245
know.|

36
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,340
0,335 335,515 515,605 605,695 695,830
What you should be getting

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,120
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,570 570,780
out of this course, the

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,475
0,555 555,735 735,1040 1060,1610 2050,2355
databases is all consuming everything

39
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:23,210
0,150 150,255 255,405 405,540 540,735
in the world, the database

40
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,085
0,350 730,1130 1270,1545 1545,1710 1710,1875
problem, and you have think

41
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,255
0,75 75,150 150,330 330,915 915,1170
of a better appreciation for

42
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:27,485
0,165 165,315 315,605 685,960 960,1230
kind of stuff. So again,

43
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,530
0,330 330,510 510,845 1375,1710 1710,2045
we'll cover this in class

44
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,760
0,290 290,580
next week.|

45
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,115
0,400 750,1150 1500,1790 1790,1985 1985,2165
But the another thing, important

46
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:33,655
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,420 420,540
thing to point out for

47
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:35,215
0,120 120,360 360,570 570,875 1315,1560
this lecture this semester this

48
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:37,270
0,255 255,605 955,1355 1375,1710 1710,2055
semester is, uh, we're griously

49
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,265
0,315 315,465 465,720 720,1070 1750,1995
sponsored by single store and

50
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,180
0,150 150,285 285,525 525,735 735,915
they're helping out with with

51
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,270
0,210 210,530 910,1310 1330,1710 1710,2090
first development. So single store

52
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,770
0,380 380,760 1110,1445 1445,1780 2100,2480
is a in memory column

53
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,735
0,380 430,825 825,1220 1240,1620 1620,1965
store distributed database system that

54
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:47,965
0,300 300,510 510,660 660,930 930,1230
supports just in time, great

55
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,080
0,545 985,1385 1465,1815 1815,2025 2025,2115
compilation. Now if none of

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,830
0,105 105,270 270,465 465,630 630,750
that makes sense for you

57
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,660
0,150 150,440 610,1160 1270,1635 1635,1830
right now that's, that's fine

58
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,680
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,825 825,1020
because we cover all these

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,060
0,195 195,435 435,830
things throughout semester.|

60
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,335
0,165 165,435 435,840 840,1095 1095,1275
And so we're grateful for

0,260 260,470 470,665 665,875 875,1025
and they'll become giving a

63
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,110
0,165 165,485 595,900 900,1205 1945,2345
guest lecture at the at

the end of the semester.|

65
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,705
0,275 275,440 440,730 900,1160 1160,1265
Some more that as we

0,120 120,395
go along.|

67
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,500
0,320 320,640 720,1160 1160,1295 1295,1460
Alright, so today's lecture real

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,090
0,260 550,870 870,1035 1035,1305 1305,1590
quickly. We're just first obviously

69
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,020
0,225 225,330 330,450 450,675 675,930
discuss the wait list. That's

70
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,530
0,90 90,195 195,285 285,390 390,510
what a lot of you

71
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,835
0,165 165,345 345,620 910,1155 1155,1305
guys care about. Then we'll

72
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:12,660
0,90 90,255 255,405 405,615 615,825
talk about the rules we

73
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,295
0,260 760,1035 1035,1365 1365,1515 1515,1635
have for lectures and then

74
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:15,015
0,165 165,315 315,465 465,600 600,720
go through all the course

75
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,390
0,510 510,750 750,1055 1105,1505 1975,2375
logistics, including homework and projects.|

76
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,485
0,245 245,335 335,455 455,590 590,755
So the first thing to

77
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,190
0,210 210,375 375,480 480,585 585,705
obviously to deal with is

78
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,575
0,105 105,255 255,560 820,1220 2110,2385
the wait list. Ah, as

79
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,415
0,165 165,330 330,540 540,675 675,840
you're probably aware of, you're

80
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:24,180
0,60 60,255 255,495 495,630 630,765
a senior student. The wait

81
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,760
0,165 165,330 330,525 525,830 1180,1580
list is quite long. Ah,

82
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,050
0,400 630,860 860,1090 1290,1640 1640,1760
and you know, there's more

83
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,905
0,135 135,240 240,330 330,590 610,855
people that can take want

84
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:29,520
0,90 90,195 195,315 315,465 465,615
to take the course than

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,830
0,105 105,240 240,420 420,915 915,1310
we can actually accommodate. So

86
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,240
0,305 305,575 575,940 960,1360 1620,1910
at this point the, the

87
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,290
0,135 135,345 345,510 510,690 690,930
CS department has taken over

88
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,060
0,165 165,285 285,560 580,980 1510,1770
the wait list from from

89
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,765
0,260 1090,1490 2440,2840 3340,3600 3600,3705
us because they they need

90
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:40,425
0,75 75,180 180,315 315,450 450,660
to make sure that certain

91
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,690
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,785 865,1265
students need to graduate and.|

92
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,235
0,365 365,730 1170,1445 1445,1715 1715,1985
You know, take our source

93
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,140
0,150 150,435 435,525 525,630 630,905
of collectives and all that

94
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,365
0,365 365,590 590,740 740,905 905,1205
and they all get preference.

95
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,255
0,275 535,935 1195,1470 1470,1755 1755,1890
So we the professors have

96
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,170
0,255 255,540 540,690 690,780 780,915
no control over the wait

97
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,760
0,290 550,950 1090,1365 1365,1485 1485,1590
list. Uh, so if you

98
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,735

send us emails there's there's

00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:52,890
0,150 150,405 405,660 660,900 900,1155
not much, there's nothing we

100
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,230
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,620 940,1340
can we can do. Um

101
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
0,320 320,500 500,800 800,920 920,1100
and the admins will then

102
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,705 705,840
move students off the wait

103
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,585
0,210 210,375 375,510 510,720 720,945
list but they're not always

104
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:58,430
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,570 570,845

105
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,885
0,400 930,1190 1190,1450 1590,1895 1895,2135
that that you you're ranked

106
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,000
0,75 75,150 150,270 270,545 715,1115

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,670
0,350 350,635 635,970 1530,2135 2135,2530
because multiple sections undergrad message.

108
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,110
0,400 630,950 950,1220 1220,1685 1685,1970
So just because you're some

110
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,480
0,305 305,425 425,665 665,965 965,1130
There's no guarantee that we

111
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,930

0,350 350,700 750,980 980,1100 1100,1390
But so the other thing

123
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,055
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,605 605,755

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,460
0,165 165,710 850,1110 1110,1320 1320,1580
be interactive. We don't just

127
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,405

0,165 165,435 435,1130 1600,1980 1980,2100
on about databases. It's always

130
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,535
0,225 225,510 510,765 765,1080 1080,1305
helpful. It's always fun when

131
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,425
0,210 210,420 420,725 1525,1770 1770,1890
students ask questions and these

132
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,000
0,240 240,450 450,615 615,935
questions be either because.|

133
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,695
0,315 315,495 495,705 705,980 1450,1695
We're talking too fast and

134
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,450
0,90 90,210 210,345 345,480 480,755
he wants to slow down.

135
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,615
0,260 260,440 440,665 665,800 800,875
I get excited when I

136
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,520
0,105 105,210 210,675 675,965 1615,1905
talk about databases. So I'm

137
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,270
0,105 105,225 225,450 450,675 675,750
going too fast. Tell me

0,75 75,165 165,240 240,330 330,450
to shut up and slow

139
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,595
0,260 1210,1485 1485,1650 1650,1785 1785,1875
down. And certainly if you

140
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:56,615
0,285 285,540 540,690 690,840 840,1020
don't understand what we're talking

141
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,515
0,315 315,615 615,675 675,780 780,900

0,165 165,485 775,1020 1020,1170 1170,1590
to interrupt, to ask clarifying

143
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,680
0,305 715,990 990,1170 1170,1395 1395,1575
questions because maybe there's something

144
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,940
0,350 700,945 945,1035 1035,1125 1125,1260

0,195 195,375 375,665 805,1065 1065,1245
that makes sense. And often

147
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,540

0,75 75,195 195,575 1195,1545 1545,1725
to ask permissions. We also

159
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,250

0,530 790,1305 1305,1500 1500,1875 1875,2010
blockchains blockchain for databases are

161
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,820
0,290 1000,1305 1305,1380 1380,1470 1470,1560

cover them. There's no need

163
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:32,260
0,105 105,365
to cover.|

164
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,360
0,270 270,1635 1635,1740 1740,1935 1935,2100
We we're not covering these

0,260 1330,1575 1575,1820 2080,2355 2355,2490
ends. So now because I

166
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,830

while we're giving the lectures,

168
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,055
0,305 305,575 575,940 1740,2030 2030,2375
that means that we don't

0,335 445,845 865,1125 1125,1275 1275,1545
right because in the past

176
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,405
0,390 390,675 675,840 840,1050 1050,1425

over and over again and

Of the database management systems.

00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,325
0,180 180,330 330,635 985,1380 1380,1710
the next lecture. But it's

198
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,195
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,735 735,870
really about how you should

199
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,160
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,675 675,965
have to build these systems.

200
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,940
0,245 245,365 365,640 810,1085 1085,1250
So this is, this is

201
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,810
0,150 150,360 360,555 555,675 675,870
of course how to use

202
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,920
0,320 520,780 780,900 900,1020 1020,1110
one, this is going how

203
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,180
0,75 75,165 165,360 360,710 880,1260
to put an application that

204
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,515
0,270 270,510 510,810 810,1125 1125,1335
that uses an m to

205
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:34,325
0,135 135,360 360,525 525,600 600,810
make calls to the database

206
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,615
0,255 255,545 655,945 945,1125 1125,1290
or whatever is really how

207
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,480
0,180 180,420 420,675 675,1175 1465,1865
you build the internals of

208
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,680
0,290 290,580
these systems.|

209
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,895
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,800 970,1215
The reason why this you

210
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:40,585
0,90 90,195 195,360 360,540 540,690
want to focus on this

211
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:41,980
0,255 255,635
topic because.|

212
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,210
0,260 260,485 485,755 755,935 935,1190
No matter where you go

213
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,590
0,285 285,435 435,570 570,860 1090,1380
in in your life, in

214
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,715
0,270 270,510 510,660 660,870 870,1125
any aspect of computer science,

215
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:46,705
0,180 180,425 475,705 705,810 810,990
where even outside of computer

216
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,640
0,305 925,1215 1215,1350 1350,1620 1620,1935
science, there'll be times where

217
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
0,765 765,915 915,1005 1005,1155 1155,1440
you're always gonna be interacting

218
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,520
0,60 60,150 150,410 910,1245 1245,1440
with the database and therefore

219
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,255
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,570 570,735
you need to know how

220
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,160
0,135 135,270 270,435 435,615 615,905
these things are actually running.

221
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,115
0,290 290,425 425,515 515,695 695,845
So if you don't go

222
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,705
0,210 210,515 985,1260 1260,1395 1395,1590
off and go to single

223
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:56,830
0,240 240,495 495,735 735,945 945,1125
store and work on actually

224
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,475
0,150 150,315 315,420 420,495 495,645
the internal of the data

225
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,600
0,305 535,780 780,885 885,1005 1005,1125
system, you need to know

226
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,815
0,240 240,390 390,555 555,860 970,1215
what's actually going on to

227
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:01,390
0,135 135,375 375,725 1225,1455 1455,1575
help you understand, you know,

228
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,025
0,290 460,860 1000,1290 1290,1455 1455,1635
why the hitting a certain

229
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:03,700
0,305
play.|

230
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,945
0,285 285,495 495,630 630,920 970,1245
I actually had people email

231
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,270
0,120 120,225 225,375 375,665 925,1325
me and tell me that

232
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,095
0,400 660,950 950,1100 1100,1205 1205,1325
you a lot of the

233
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,030
0,495 495,815 835,1395 1395,1560 1560,1935
concepts they databases are applicable

234
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,085
0,105 105,270 270,590 1480,1785 1785,2055
to other things like queuing

235
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:12,895
0,210 210,405 405,540 540,690 690,810
systems and what not. So

236
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,170
0,245 295,660 660,915 915,1110 1110,1275
like you, the things were

237
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,640
0,165 165,330 330,680 1000,1305 1305,1470
coming this semester I think

238
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,795
0,105 105,240 240,435 435,740 850,1155
will be super useful throughout

239
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,140
0,180 180,405 405,755
your entire career.|

240
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,050
0,400 570,875 875,1085 1085,1390 1410,1670
So if you want to

241
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,905
0,180 180,405 405,600 600,735 735,855
learn about how to use

242
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:21,790
0,120 120,315 315,585 585,765 765,885
a database system or how

243
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,335
0,135 135,650 850,1290 1290,1350 1350,1545
to administrate administer a database

244
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:24,570
0,270 270,450 450,615 615,765 765,1235
system, like being a dba,

245
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,545
0,410 410,590 590,755 755,1025 1025,1265
there's a couple courses in

246
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:27,610
0,270 270,525 525,795 795,945 945,1065
Heinz college that you should

247
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,260
0,150 150,420 420,800 1270,1515 1515,1650
probably take instead. This is

248
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,685
0,210 210,435 435,740 790,1185 1185,1425
really about like people want

249
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:31,590
0,75 75,225 225,405 405,585 585,905
to get their hands dirty

250
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,995
0,335 335,560 560,800 800,920 920,1055
on the internals of these

251
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:33,880
0,275
systems.|

252
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,300
0,350 350,590 590,725 725,1100 1100,1190
Right. So the logistics of

253
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,095
0,90 90,350 370,630 630,720 720,795
the course, everything will be

254
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,050
0,75 75,165 165,315 315,605 1465,1955
on the course website. We'll

255
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,700
0,275 275,575 575,770 770,980 980,1300
be publishing that very soon.

256
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,245
0,400 420,770 770,1025 1025,1325 1325,1625
The all the discussions and

257
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,415
0,450 450,630 630,765 765,1005 1005,1170
announcements throughout the semester will

258
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,260
0,105 105,300 300,540 540,1115 1465,1845
be done through piazza. Um,

259
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,505
0,285 285,495 495,750 750,990 990,1245
all the homework and projects

260
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:48,860
0,225 225,360 360,630 630,840 840,1355
will be submitted through grope.

261
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,080
0,320 320,500 500,620 620,1120 1470,1870
Everything will be autaded, um,

262
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,640
0,260 260,380 380,500 500,740 740,1150
and then the final grades

263
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,420
0,260 260,410 410,700 780,1175 1175,1520
will be posted on on

264
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,205
0,350 850,1095 1095,1200 1200,1365 1365,1785
campus again if you're enrolled

265
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:58,080
0,120 120,285 285,575 775,1175
in the course. Ah.|

266
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,505
0,575 575,785 785,1025 1025,1385 1385,1625
Officially, you should have access

267
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:01,210
0,60 60,165 165,330 330,525 525,705
to all these things right

268
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,080
0,260
now.|

269
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,600
0,275 275,410 410,575 575,680 680,970
So if you're a non

270
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,675
0,290 290,485 485,755 755,965 965,1055
C U student because I

271
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,230
0,105 105,195 195,285 285,375 375,555
know a lot of you

272
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,850
0,315 315,570 570,860 940,1245 1245,1620
outside, you like watch lectures

273
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,605
0,290 310,675 675,1040 1330,1605 1605,1755
and project well we have

274
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:12,590
0,165 165,435 435,780 780,1145 2665,2985
a separate grade scope account

275
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,325
0,165 165,270 270,375 375,495 495,735
set up for the course

276
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:14,590
0,240 240,420 420,720 720,990 990,1265
that will mirror what the

277
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,790
0,335 335,545 545,680 680,830 830,1120
official C U one does

278
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,585
0,260 260,365 365,470 470,605 605,785
and you can use this

279
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,920
0,255 255,540 540,825 825,1095 1095,1335
code to to log in

280
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,030
0,300 300,585 585,810 810,1005 1005,1110
and and get access to

0,195 195,405 405,510 510,645 645,825
it and this will allow

282
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:21,800
0,180 180,330 330,540 540,735 735,945
you to submit your projects

283
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,835
0,225 225,390 390,705 705,855 855,1035
and get graded the same

284
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:25,100
0,305 1135,1515 1515,1770 1770,1995 1995,2265
way that the senior students

285
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,675
0,320 700,1080 1080,1305 1305,1410 1410,1575
do. So again, if you're

0,315 315,525 525,660 660,870 870,1065
that actually is not run

00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,990
0,245 715,1050 1050,1245 1245,1365 1365,1625
it has set this up.

298
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,125
0,275 275,395 395,530 530,695 695,815

0,400 420,785 785,1040 1040,1175 1175,1295
various aspects before, so I

301
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:54,660

0,275 275,425 425,695 695,1070 1070,1340
I ask if someone please

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,760
0,195 195,360 360,890

309
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,970
0,215 215,430 450,695 695,800 800,980
You know, there was some

310
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,035
0,320 340,585 585,705 705,855 855,1065
stuff that was sort of

311
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,520
0,270 270,510 510,705 705,995 1195,1485
true, not true. Whatever. Someone

312
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,165
0,150 150,285 285,435 435,555 555,645
could fix that for me,

313
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,340
0,60 60,120 120,270 270,575
that would be great.|

314
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,990
0,320 320,395 395,650 650,755 755,860
There's a textbook for the

315
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,240
0,260 850,1185 1185,1455 1455,1995 1995,2250
course database systems concepts from

316
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,900
0,270 270,560 1030,1430 1510,1910 2260,2660
server shots or generation. Um,

317
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,535
0,580 780,1130 1130,1480 1590,1865 1865,2045
it's not required like there's

318
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:25,330
0,120 120,330 330,525 525,645 645,795
no homework that are based

319
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,380
0,150 150,410 610,855 855,945 945,1050
on it. But if you

320
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,105
0,195 195,705 705,950 970,1365 1365,1725
want supplemental reading beyond, we

321
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,105
0,365 1165,1425 1425,1560 1560,1835 2695,3000
discuss in the class you

322
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:32,275
0,195 195,495 495,765 765,945 945,1170
be reading, you can go

323
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,570
0,365 1015,1320 1320,1560 1560,1895 1975,2295
and dive deeper into various

324
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,965
0,320 550,950 1030,1245 1245,1305 1305,1395
topics. Now there are gonna

325
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,225
0,150 150,405 405,705 705,975 975,1260
be some things that we

326
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,370
0,365 505,885 885,1265 1495,1905 1905,2145
discuss that the textbook doesn't

327
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,660
0,260 460,705 705,900 900,1095 1095,1290
cover. I don't covers as

328
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,700
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,770
well as they should.|

329
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,275
0,255 255,570 570,800 1060,1395 1395,1575
And that's what we'll provide

330
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,445
0,240 240,480 480,660 660,930 930,1170
lecture notes as PDF files

331
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,790
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,935 3055,3345
that are available there, whether

332
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,405
0,135 135,225 225,315 315,450 450,615
you need to buy this

333
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,820
0,360 360,510 510,785
textbook or not.|

334
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,930
0,305 305,395 395,500 500,665 665,890
It's up to you. It

335
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,300
0,165 165,285 285,530 610,990 990,1370
depends on how up you

336
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,150
0,290 290,410 410,470 470,560 560,710
really want to go into

337
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,600
0,290
this.|

338
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,315
0,335 335,545 545,695 695,950 950,1175
Ah, so the grading rubric

339
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,905
0,105 105,195 195,515 1105,1410 1410,1590
for this semester is me

340
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:01,910
0,275 475,720 720,810 810,885 885,1005
falling. So this is a

341
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,050
0,240 240,525 525,840 840,1050 1050,1140
project heavy course. So the

342
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,775
0,420 420,525 525,645 645,920 1480,1725
45% of the grade will

343
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:05,680
0,105 105,285 285,480 480,630 630,905
be based on your projects.

344
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,830
0,245 245,380 380,530 530,635 635,740
And I discuss what these

345
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,890
0,105 105,180 180,285 285,560 1660,2060
are in a second. The

346
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,190
0,400 480,880 900,1450 1590,1880 1880,2170
be five assignments, four projects,

347
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,015
0,260 260,365 365,680 680,980 980,1325
then a midterm exam and

348
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:15,440
0,315 315,665 925,1200 1200,1320 1320,1425
a final. You see the

349
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
0,375 375,710
breakdown here.|

350
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,510
0,305 305,470 470,635 635,770 770,1000
Right, so all the homework

351
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,950
0,260 260,520 690,995 995,1160 1160,1420
will be based on the

352
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,745
0,275 275,410 410,635 635,1000 1230,1535
material we cover in, in

353
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,290
0,305 595,915 915,1185 1185,1395 1395,1545
class and in the assign

354
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,600
0,410 1180,1485 1485,1755 1755,2055 2055,2310
readings. The first homework assignment

355
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,860
0,90 90,240 240,435 435,855 855,1260
will be a sql assignment

356
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,480
0,290 310,660 660,920 1180,1455 1455,1620
or sl project where you

357
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,255
0,165 165,315 315,495 495,980 2500,2775
write some s queries against

358
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,025
0,120 120,285 285,605 1045,1445 1465,1770
the data set and see

359
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:35,580
0,210 210,515 1765,2025 2025,2220 2220,2555
correct answer everything. After that

360
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,685
0,335 335,515 515,620 620,785 785,1025
homework will be all pencil

361
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,140
0,335 535,795 795,960 960,1095 1095,1455
paper but you'll still sniffers

362
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,055
0,150 150,315 315,525 525,735 735,915
and gr code in and

363
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:40,380
0,105 105,435 435,555 555,815
the autograph it there.|

364
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,120
0,400 540,875 875,1100 1100,1390 1410,1730
Again, it c you everyone

365
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,280
0,210 210,495 495,765 765,900 900,1160
knows that all your homework

366
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,495
0,245 245,335 335,580 1200,1750 1860,2195
should be done individually and

367
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,000
0,210 210,555 555,875 985,1245 1245,1505
you shouldn't copy each other.|

368
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,095
0,290 290,500 500,820 870,1145 1145,1295
All the projects will be

369
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:50,920
0,165 165,300 300,420 420,615 615,825
based on a system we've

370
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,990
0,90 90,300 300,555 555,765 765,1070
been building for several years

371
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,150
0,400 4020,4355 4355,4535 4535,4625 4625,4870
here class. What the name

372
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,860
0,335 335,670 2430,2720 2720,3010
actually means came from.|

373
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,870
0,290 730,1095 1095,1455 1455,1800 1800,2010
Ah, but the idea here

374
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,250
0,210 210,560 940,1260 1260,1490 2020,3380
is that it's a it's

375
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,920
0,350 350,755 755,965 965,1300 1620,2020
educational testbed data system where

376
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,505
0,395 395,560 560,740 740,905 905,1115
you do all your projects

377
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,855
0,255 255,420 420,690 690,1005 1005,1350
on and you'll see over

378
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,070
0,360 360,615 615,735 735,945 945,1215
time as you add more

379
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,660
0,285 285,480 480,660 660,1010 1300,1590
features to the system, you'll

380
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,635
0,75 75,165 165,375 375,660 660,975
get a better understanding how,

381
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:16,840
0,330 330,665
how the.|

382
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,040
0,270 270,420 420,600 600,975 975,1200
All the there layers fit

383
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,990
0,255 255,560 730,990 990,1250 1630,1950
together and you can run

384
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,880
0,345 345,620 1120,1440 1440,1635 1635,1890
queries and results based on

385
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,220
0,255 255,435 435,615 615,890
stuff you actually go.|

386
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,035
0,400 720,1085 1085,1325 1325,1580 1580,1715
So it's very important that

387
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:25,830
0,90 90,255 255,450 450,675 675,795
you don't fall behind on

388
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,045
0,90 90,350 400,705 705,945 945,1215
the projects because every project

389
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:27,675
0,180 180,270 270,375 375,510 510,630
is going to build on

390
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:28,995
0,105 105,365 745,1005 1005,1125 1125,1320
the previous, like in project

391
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,565
0,210 210,360 360,405 405,480 480,570
one, you're going to build

392
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,035
0,105 105,360 360,755 1105,1350 1350,1470
a buff manager. Then in

393
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:31,845

project two, you're going to

394
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:33,690
0,245 595,930 930,1200 1200,1530 1530,1845
build an index that that

395
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,860

0,470 1870,2130 2130,2295 2295,2460 2460,2655
emptypy. So it's really important

397
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:38,270
0,120 120,240 240,375 375,495 495,755
that you stay on track,

0,305 305,575 575,940 1260,1660 1680,1970
start projects early and and

399
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,660
0,225 225,420 420,770
don't fall behind.|

403
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,270
0,275 275,515 515,725 725,905 905,1070
The assumptions that you're coming

404
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,440
0,320 340,630 630,870 870,1065 1065,1170
into this class with the

405
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,570
0,675 675,1035 1035,1430 1600,1905 1905,2130

plus plus, um and so

408
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:01,995
0,105 105,210 210,270 270,330 330,450
I think it was a

409
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,900
0,150 150,315 315,765 765,1055 1645,1905
post on piazza whether two,

410
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,145

thirteen, five, thirteen was was

411
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,465
0,270 270,390 390,635 775,1005 1005,1320
enough of this. The answer's

412
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,075
0,275 2035,2280 2280,2355 2355,2430 2430,2610
no, some of the things

413
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:09,720
0,270 270,360 360,450 450,540 540,645
you'll be able to pick

414
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,400
0,260 880,1140 1140,1245 1245,1395 1395,1680

0,285 285,630 630,930 930,1095 1095,1230
but it's, it's a little

416
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,160
0,290 400,690 690,980 1090,1380 1380,1530
I little more than two

0,150 150,390 390,860
second, but there.|

project released. After you've sort

432
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:32,870
0,90 90,210 210,345 345,465 465,645
of looked at the code,

433
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,725
0,150 150,255 255,420 420,600 600,855
you can come ask questions

434
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:34,910
0,255 255,545 595,840 840,960 960,1185

0,305 305,530 530,845 845,1160 1160,1460
So as posted in the,

438
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,950
0,255 255,450 450,750 750,990 990,1140

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,225
0,165 165,435 435,770 910,1170 1170,1275
post that again, there is

00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,545
0,120 120,395 415,750 750,1035 1035,1320
a project zero that require

441
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:44,535
0,335 355,660 660,825 825,915 915,990
all students that want to

442
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,810
0,120 120,270 270,545 805,1080 1080,1275
take the class have to

443
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,360
0,320 670,945 945,1095 1095,1260 1260,1550
complete. And this is really

444
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,095
0,395 395,680 680,920 920,1265 1265,1505
A A safety mechanism to

445
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,355

make sure that you're coming

446
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:51,840

to this class prepared to

447
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,910
0,225 225,450 450,585 585,765 765,1070
write c plus plus code

448
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,695
0,290 290,575 575,980 980,1250 1250,1685
and so it's not graded

449
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:56,610
0,135 135,270 270,405 405,690 690,915
in that it doesn't affect

450
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,465
0,150 150,375 375,615 615,735 735,855
your final score in the

451

0,275 595,840 840,1035 1035,1320 1320,1620
class which you required to

452
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,125
0,240 240,515 895,1295 1555,1860 1860,2040
complete it because again, we

0,180 180,285 285,555 555,795 795,900
Don't know C I think

455
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,475
0,135 135,240 240,390 390,480 480,555
they're gonna pick it up

456
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,195
0,105 105,225 225,375 375,555 555,720
as they go along throughout

457
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,785
0,120 120,425 805,1065 1065,1275 1275,1590
the semester and then realize,

458
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,375
0,365 655,915 915,1080 1080,1335 1335,1590
oh, I have know c

459
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,455
0,255 255,495 495,675 675,870 870,1080
plus learn c plus and

460
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,510
0,180 180,420 420,630 630,765 765,1055
learn Davis the same time.

461
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,620
0,320 320,640 1260,1550 1550,1715 1715,1880
It it does not end

462
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,955
0,255 255,495 495,770 970,1260 1260,1335
well. Trust me, we've done

463
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:14,990
0,135 135,315 315,555 555,825 825,1035
this up that we realize

464
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,535
0,150 150,330 330,650 1060,1350 1350,1545
that this really, really help

465
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,485
0,305 625,915 915,1205 1585,1845 1845,1950
you rather than make your

466
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:20,075
0,245 655,1055 1075,1335 1335,1455 1455,1590
life. So if you do

467
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,530
0,275 295,585 585,810 810,1125 1125,1455
not complete this, this project

468
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,240
0,350 580,900 900,1095 1095,1455 1455,1710
zero by the deadline of

469
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,310
0,330 330,710 1660,1980 1980,2025 2025,2070
september tenth, we're going to

470
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,700
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,710
ask you to drop.|

471
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,050
0,285 285,615 615,900 900,1245 1245,1350
And, and zero exceptions we

472
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,580
0,260 760,1005 1005,1185 1185,1350 1350,1530
made. I don't care that

473
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,770
0,150 150,435 435,720 720,900 900,1190
your brother took five, thirteen,

474
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,890
0,275 275,470 470,710 710,890 890,1040
ten years ago. And you

475
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,820
0,165 165,420 420,690 690,825 825,930
and you saw what he

476
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,765
0,150 150,315 315,480 480,735 735,945
did back then. Like, it

477
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,820
0,255 255,515 1495,1755 1755,1890 1890,2055
doesn't matter. You have to

478
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,675
0,165 165,315 315,465 465,720 720,855
complete this. It shouldn't take

479
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:37,725
0,120 120,240 240,435 435,675 675,1050
that much time, right? It's

480
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,180
0,210 210,345 345,600 600,965
a pretty basic trial.|

481
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,500
0,365 365,590 590,850 1320,1720 2340,2740
For office hours be myself

482
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,710
0,515 515,755 755,875 875,995 995,1130
desh and the T A

483
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,140
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,830 2140,2430
will hold office hours at

484
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,100
0,195 195,435 435,645 645,780 780,960
various times throughout the week

485
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
0,320 850,1140 1140,1380 1380,1665 1665,2000
but between monday and friday

486
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,165
0,275 275,550 720,995 995,1265 1265,1415
and then there won't be

487
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:54,430
0,305 505,765 765,1025 1465,1865 1885,2265
any office hours regularly on

0,890 1090,1425 1425,1680 1680,1950 1950,2300
saturdays, but the day before

489
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,110
0,305 305,545 545,800 800,1025 1025,1330
the every project is due,

has a play manager checker

589
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,855
0,260 260,455 455,635 635,725 725,815
and basically what we do

590
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:00,620
0,105 105,240 240,405 405,600 600,765
is we find all the

591
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,045
0,255 255,735 735,975 975,1170 1170,1425
github implications from non senior

592
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,800
0,335 685,975 975,1125 1125,1380 1380,1755
students, load them up into

593
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,390
0,530 730,1050 1050,1275 1275,1440 1440,1590
github into great code but

594
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,770
0,195 195,500 820,1065 1065,1215 1215,1380
take students and then see

595
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,750
0,135 135,255 255,435 435,675 675,980
whether you match against them.

596
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,055
0,400 780,1025 1025,1270 1620,1865 1865,2015
Ah, do not do not

597
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:10,880
0,210 210,375 375,510 510,645 645,825
copy your source code from

598
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,065
0,225 225,360 360,590 730,1020 1020,1185
students. Do not source code

599
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,675
0,150 150,545 1735,2025 2025,2400 2400,2610
from github. The github source

600
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:15,770
0,165 165,285 285,480 480,720 720,1095
code is usually pretty crappy.

601
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,045
0,225 225,390 390,615 615,920 1030,1275
We've done experience before she

602
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,590
0,120 120,270 270,545 745,1145 1255,1545
has done this. Ah, the

603
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,850
0,330 330,600 600,915 915,1095 1095,1260
cu students crush the non

604
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,155
0,180 180,330 330,540 540,840 840,1305
C U students so it's

605
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:21,890
0,180 180,240 240,345 345,525 525,735
actually in your best interest

606
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,880
0,150 150,255 255,420 420,740
not to copy now.|

607
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,480
0,400
Again.|

608
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,635
0,180 180,390 390,465 465,660 660,1155
There won't be any exceptions.

609
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:27,780
0,255 255,420 420,630 630,810 810,1145
Oh, I didn't know. Yeah,

610
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,780
0,260 260,395 395,530 530,635 635,830
the fact that this is

611
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,530
0,350 610,1010 1480,1725 1725,1970 2350,2750
recorded, uh, a lecture. If

612
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,335
0,260 260,380 380,530 530,680 680,785
we have to report you

613
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,340
0,105 105,330 330,540 540,810 810,1005
to Warner hall, we point

614
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,690
0,135 135,380 610,930 930,1155 1155,1350
to this time stamp in

615
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,350
0,150 150,255 255,390 390,540 540,660
in the lecture and say

616
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,070
0,90 90,225 225,375 375,570 570,720
where I'm warning you enough

617
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,330
0,105 105,560 850,1095 1095,1170 1170,1260
to plagiarize and then you

618
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,950
0,470 880,1200 1200,1365 1365,1485 1485,1620
plagiarize. Yeah, and if not,

619
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,040
0,180 180,435 435,740 1000,1400 1690,2090
you're screwed, right? Um, if

620
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,070
0,350 350,515 515,695 695,830 830,980
there's something you want to

621
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,390
0,290 520,825 825,1065 1065,1245 1245,1320
do that seems kind of

622
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,425
0,150 150,375 375,585 585,840 840,1035
like grey zone and you

623
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,240
0,135 135,225 225,315 315,525 525,815
don't know if it's okay

624
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
0,290 290,580 660,1025 1025,1250 1250,1400
like using t or something

625
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,345
0,150 150,315 315,620 1600,2000 2260,2505
like that, right? Please. You

626
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:50,980
0,180 180,495 495,750 750,1025 1345,1635
know, email myself in not

627
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,050
0,150 150,410 430,690 690,810 810,1070
the t to see whether

628
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,300
0,230 230,460
you know.|

629
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,350
0,335 335,515 515,635 635,755 755,830
And see whether we want

630
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,180
0,105 105,255 255,530 1390,1650 1650,1830
to discuss it. And then

631
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,885
0,180 180,315 315,465 465,585 585,705
the link there would be

632
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,235
0,315 315,480 480,735 735,1065 1065,1350
foreseen use policy or academic

633
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,555
0,515 685,945 945,1065 1065,1185 1185,1320
integrity. Again, we take this

634
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:02,400
0,180 180,485 1585,1980 1980,2315
very seriously, don't around.|

635
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,690
0,350 350,560 560,635 635,695 695,860
But one of the last

636
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,270
0,255 255,465 465,740 880,1230 1230,1580
thing is that if you

637
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,285

do and you go beyond

639
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,985
0,210 210,435 435,785 1495,1740 1740,1830
the course material, we are

640
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,110

offering a seminar series this

641
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,020
0,270 270,585 585,795 795,1340 1510,1910
semester. It's entirely optional, um,

642
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,040
0,305 305,545 545,880 900,1295 1295,1610
where every monday starting in

643
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,980
0,320 760,1020 1020,1275 1275,1670
september, we having a.|

644
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,600
0,320 340,660 660,960 960,1340 1360,1620
Different outside speaker come give

645

a talk about the various

646
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,920
0,320 760,1080 1080,1290 1290,1580 1900,2160
datab company or project. So

647
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,745
0,165 165,420 420,555 555,660 660,825
this semester of the theme

648
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:25,960
0,255 255,465 465,615 615,750 750,1215
is machine learning for databases

649
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,615
0,135 135,645 645,900 900,1190 2350,2655
and databaseases machine learning. And

650
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,445
0,240 240,465 465,755 1225,1590 1590,1830
so we have people that

651
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,125
0,165 165,455 1135,1425 1425,1590 1590,1680
are building a lot of

652
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,175
0,215 265,540 540,690 690,870 870,1050
these hot thing now, these

653
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,825
0,210 210,660 660,935 1195,1470 1470,1650
vector databases, but discuss next

654
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:37,165
0,305 535,935 1675,1965 1965,2115 2115,2340
class, but we're having them

655
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,515
0,240 240,465 465,755 835,1170 1170,1350
talked about their systems, how

656
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,230
0,210 210,555 555,1125 1125,1395 1395,1715
to support lm like stuff

657
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,905
0,245 245,335 335,485 485,790 1170,1445
inside of data systems. And

658
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,090
0,150 150,360 360,615 615,930 930,1185
then we'll have people talk

659
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,350
0,320 370,645 645,810 810,1020 1020,1260
about how they're using machine

660
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,260
0,260 580,975 975,1320 1320,1560 1560,1910
learning to optimize data systems,

661
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,320
0,245 245,350 350,610
sort of like.|

662
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,625
0,365 365,575 575,680 680,800 800,995
Using to make the system

663
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,140
0,285 285,635 985,1230 1230,1365 1365,1515
actually faster. So again this

664
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,790
0,120 120,680 1090,1350 1350,1470 1470,1650
is optional. Everything will be

665
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,455
0,270 270,650 1060,1320 1320,1575 1575,1665
on zoom on mondays at

666

0,150 150,425 445,720 720,995 2095,2340
four thirty and then they

667
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:56,875
0,105 105,255 255,435 435,725 745,1080
will post it on Youtube

0,105 105,240 240,300 300,360 360,420
you don't have to be

670
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,830
0,90 90,315 315,660 660,990 990,1200
a senior, neither you can

671
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,280
0,135 135,285 285,435 435,710
join it if you.|

672
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,090
0,230 230,320 320,440 440,545 545,710
You can see the list

673
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,490
0,150 150,315 315,540 540,830 1000,1400
of the football full schedule.|

674
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,655
0,350 350,695 695,1025 1025,1100 1100,1205
Alright, so that's it for

675
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:07,710
0,105 105,365 415,815 1645,1905 1905,2055
the log class. I gotta

676
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,860
0,150 150,410 520,885 885,1250
figure out what about?|

677
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,705

soon. That's about, but it's

679
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,055
0,290 460,840 840,1140 1140,1460 1600,1875
okay. So next class on

680
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:17,790

class lecture and then we'll

682
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,745
0,290 550,825 825,930 930,990 990,1065
begin right out of the

683
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,035
0,180 180,405 405,585 585,765 765,1290
gate. Not talking any logistics,

684
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:22,890
0,195 195,285 285,465 465,690 690,855
