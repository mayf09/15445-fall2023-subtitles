1
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,840
He's in there?

2
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:24,980
He's not good now.

3
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,820
What's up, guys.

4
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,570
I'm over there at the [] city, DJ [] is in there, it's not good,

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,125
whatever, he's behind on child support,

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,640
so let's just go through this.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,455
So again the purpose of this lecture is,

8
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,560
we want to discuss the logistics for the course,

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,340
now you know online rather than in person,

10
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,220
and so that way in the first day of class next week,

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,435
we can just jump into all the daily stuff right away.

12
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,760
All right, so let let's go through this.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,050
The reason again, why, why am I down here at the county [],

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,205
well, because, because of databases, right,

15
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,160
and this is what this course is really all about,

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,300
about we focusing on the like the most important things in your in your life

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,160
and yeah sometimes bad things happen,

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,520
so for me, the the two most important things in my life,

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,070
are my wife and my biological daughter,

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,550
first their number one, and then after that is databases,

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,910
that's really, you know what you should be getting out of this course,

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,730
the databases is all consuming,

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,560
everything in the world, the database problem,

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,860
and you have think of a better appreciation for kind of stuff.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,130
So again, we'll cover this in class next week.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,820
All right, the another thing, important thing to point out for this lecture this semester this semester is,

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,340
we're griously sponsored by SingleStore

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,710
and they're helping out with with course development,

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,390
so SingleStore is a in-memory column store distributed database system,

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,510
that supports just in time, great compilation,

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,660
now if none of that makes sense for you right now, that's, that's fine,

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,510
because we cover all these things throughout semester,

33
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,570
and so we're grateful for them helping helping us out,

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,610
and they'll become giving a guest lecture at the at the end of the semester,

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,100
some more that as we go along.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,760
Alright, so today's lecture real quickly,

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,765
we're just first obviously discuss the waitlist,

38
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:11,150
that's what a lot of you guys care about,

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,025
then we'll talk about the rules we have for lectures

40
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,525
and then go through all the course logistics,

41
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,390
including homework and projects.

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,750
So the first thing to obviously to deal with is the wait list,

43
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,760
as you're probably aware of, you're a senior student, the wait list is quite long,

44
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,435
and you know, there's more people that can take want to take the course than we can actually accommodate,

45
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:36,320
so at this point the, the CS department has taken over the wait list from from us,

46
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,210
because they they need to make sure that certain students need to graduate

47
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,140
and you know, take our source of collectives and all that

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,365
and they all get preference,

49
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,460
so we the professors have no control over the wait list,

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,230
so if you send us emails there's there's not much, there's nothing we can we can do,

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,850
and the admins will then move students off the wait list,

52
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,000
but they're not always gonna go in the order that that you you're ranked in the wait list,

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,670
because multiple sections undergrad message,

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,910
so just because you're some low on wait list,

55
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,250
there's no guarantee that we can get you in the semester,

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,380
the good news is that,

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,060
since we've hired Jignesh Patel as the new data professor with me here at Carnegie Mellon,

58
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,560
we can now offer 15-445/645 every semester,

59
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,540
so it'll be offered again in in Spring 2024 in addition to this semester.

60
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,500
All right, so the other thing,

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,780
when we have the in class lectures,

62
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,280
it's really important that,

63
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,590
I wanted to be interactive,

64
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,800
we don't just stand up there for, you know, an hour

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,260
and paddle on about databases,

66
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,455
it's always helpful,

67
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,260
it's always fun, when students ask questions

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,360
and these questions be either because,

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,450
we're talking too fast and he wants to slow down,

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,290
I get excited when I talk about databases,

71
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,980
so I'm going too fast, tell me to shut up and slow down,

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,930
and certainly if you don't understand what we're talking about,

73
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,000
it's a good time to interrupt,

74
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,410
to ask clarifying questions,

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,090
because maybe there's something about, you know, in the slides or the discussion that that makes sense,

76
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,830
and often times too, if you have questions,

77
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,880
other people have a have same questions as well,

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,325
so please, anytime during the lectures,

79
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,550
please interrupt us with anything that stated it's related,

80
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,450
what we don't want interrupted about is whether or not you can go to the bathroom,

81
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,350
because, you're an adult, you don't have to ask permissions,

82
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,780
we also don't want be interrupted about blockchains,

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,550
blockchain for databases are stupid,

84
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,920
we're not going to cover them, there's no need to cover,

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,620
we we're not covering these ends.

86
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,660
So now because I want you to interrupt us while we're giving the lectures,

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,350
that means that we don't want you to come at the end of the end of the lecture and say,

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,770
oh, you know what about slide three, I did this didn't make sense it over, right,

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,405
because in the past we we've always finished lectures,

90
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:56,050
and you know, several students lined up asking the same question over and over again

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,535
and again, so that's why I'm saying,

92
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,100
if you interrupt us as we're going along,

93
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,590
you know, it help everyone at the same time,

94
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,890
so please, we won't answer any questions about the slides immediately after class.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,510
So what is this course,

96
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:18,610
so 15-445/645 is a course about the design and implementation of of the database management systems,

97
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,940
now we we're going to discuss relational database management systems

98
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,250
and we'll cover that in the next lecture,

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,160
but it's really about how you should have to build these systems,

100
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,130
so this isn't, this isn't of course how to use one,

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,305
this isn't going how to put an application that that uses an ORM

102
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,870
to make calls to the database or whatever,

103
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,110
is really how you build the internals of these systems.

104
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,840
The reason why this you want to focus on this topic,

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,070
because no matter where you go in in your life,

106
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,715
in any aspect of computer science,

107
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,010
where even outside of computer science,

108
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,490
there'll be times, where you're always gonna be interacting with the database

109
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,160
and therefore you need to know how these things are actually running,

110
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,945
so if you don't go off and go to SingleStore

111
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,780
and work on actually the internal of the data system,

112
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,460
you need to know what's actually going on

113
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,330
to help you understand, you know, why the system behaving a certain way,

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,270
I actually had people email me and tell me that,

115
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,620
a lot of the concepts they databases are applicable to other things,

116
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,775
like queuing systems and what not,

117
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,850
so like, the things were coming this semester,

118
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,550
I think will be super useful throughout your entire career.

119
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,490
So if you want to learn about how to use a database system

120
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,570
or how to administrate administer a database system, like being a DBA,

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,410
there's a couple courses in Heinz college that you should probably take instead,

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,270
this is really about like people want to get their hands dirty on the internals of these systems.

123
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,650
All right, so the logistics of the course,

124
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,700
everything will be on the course website,

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,700
we'll be publishing that very soon,

126
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,260
the all the discussions and announcements throughout the semester will be done through Piazza,

127
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,860
all the homework and projects will be submitted through Gradescope,

128
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,080
everything will be autograded,

129
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,770
and then the final grades will be posted on on Canvas,

130
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,380
again if you're enrolled in the course,

131
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,470
officially, you should have access to all these things right now.

132
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,375
So if you're a non-CMU student,

133
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,545
because I know a lot of you outside,

134
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,525
you like watch lectures and project,

135
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:13,325
well, we have a separate Gradescope account set up for the course,

136
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,790
that will mirror what the official CMU one does

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,225
and you can use this code to to log in and and get access to it

138
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,505
and this will allow you to submit your projects and get graded,

139
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:25,420
the same way that the CMU students do,

140
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,425
so again, if you're non-CMU student,

141
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:32,350
we ask you since we're providing this, this materials for you for your charge,

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,000
please don't post your solutions on Github,

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,180
please don't email myself or Jignesh or TAs for help,

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,800
we have so many people we need help here at CMU,

145
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,690
we can't help everyone,

146
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,320
there is a Discord Channel that actually is not run by CMU,

147
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,990
somebody outside of it has set this up,

148
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,550
this sort of become the de facto location for discussing various aspects before,

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,130
so I encourage you to sign and check that out.

150
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,870
And again, in in exchange for helping us out with this

151
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,860
or you us helping everyone with these these materials,

152
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,280
I ask if someone please finish my Wikipedia article,

153
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,030
you know, there was some stuff that was sort of true, not true, whatever,

154
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,740
someone could fix that for me, that would be great.

155
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,250
There's a textbook for the course,

156
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,900
database systems concepts from Silberschatz Korth Sudarshan,

157
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,970
it's not required,

158
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,740
like there's no homework that are based on it,

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,745
but if you want supplemental reading beyond,

160
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:31,600
we discuss in the class you be reading,

161
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,890
you can go and dive deeper into various topics,

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,630
now there are gonna be some things that we discuss that the textbook doesn't cover,

163
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,430
I don't covers as well as they should,

164
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,380
and that's what we'll provide lecture notes as PDF files that are available there,

165
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,190
whether you need to buy this textbook or not,

166
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,705
it's up to you,

167
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,440
it depends on how up you really want to go into this.

168
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,180
All right, so the grading rubric for this semester is me falling,

169
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,750
so this is a project heavy course,

170
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,680
so the 45% of the grade will be based on your projects,

171
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,390
and I discuss what these are in a second,

172
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,680
the be five assignments, four projects, then a midterm exam and a final,

173
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,150
You see the breakdown here.

174
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,700
All right, so all the homework will be based on the material we cover in, in class and in the assign readings,

175
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,780
the first homework assignment will be a SQL assignment or SQL project,

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,540
where you write some SQL queries against the data set and see correct answer,

177
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,020
everything after that homework will be all pencil paper,

178
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,870
but you'll still see and code in and the autograded it there,

179
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,615
again, it CMU everyone knows that,

180
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,000
all your homework should be done individually and you shouldn't copy each other.

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,990
All the projects will be based on a system we've been building for several years, called BusTub,

182
00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:00,330
we discuss in the class, what the name actually means, came from,

183
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,430
but the idea here is that,

184
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,200
it's a, it's educational test database system,

185
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,505
where you do all your projects

186
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,215
on and you'll see over time,

187
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:14,080
as you add more features to the system,

188
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,320
you'll get a better understanding,

189
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,295
how, how the, all the there layers fit together

190
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:22,770
and you can run queries and results based on stuff you actually go.

191
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,180
So it's very important that you don't fall behind on the projects,

192
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,040
because every project is going to build on the previous,

193
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,320
like in project one, you're going to build a buffer manager,

194
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,045
then in project two, you're going to build an index,

195
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,330
that that gets pages or gets gets empty,

196
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,515
so it's really important,

197
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:38,270
that you stay on track,

198
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,150
start projects early and and don't fall behind.

199
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,840
BusTub is written in C++, I think 2017,

200
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,340
we don't use all the advanced features,

201
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,010
but the,

202
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,140
the assumptions that you're coming into this class

203
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,720
with the familiarity and and being comfortable with writing and debugging C++,

204
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,760
and so I think it was a post on Piazza,

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,780
whether 213 513 was, was enough of this,

206
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,740
the answer's no,

207
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
some of the things you'll be able to pick up as you go along,

208
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,420
but it's, it's a little I little more than 213.

209
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,270
I'll cover later days in a second,

210
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:17,980
but there,

211
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,560
well, the late days are only allowed for projects and the homework

212
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,630
and you're given four late days, that you can use for any project,

213
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,580
as as we go along,

214
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,330
and as we release each project,

215
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,520
there'll be an online presentation,

216
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,060
that will hold where you can come ask,

217
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,240
you a week after the project released,

218
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,870
after you've sort of looked at the code,

219
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,910
you can come ask questions about it with the TAs

220
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,580
and before that make that available for everone.

221
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,560
So as posted in the, in the email,

222
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,720
and I'll post that again,

223
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,975
there is a project zero,

224
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,130
that require all students that want to take the class have to complete,

225
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,855
and this is really a safety mechanism,

226
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:52,910
to make sure that you're coming to this class prepared to write C++ code,

227
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,965
and so it's not graded in that,

228
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,740
it doesn't affect your final score in the class,

229
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,600
which you required to complete it,

230
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,575
because again, we don't want people who don't know C++,

231
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,620
I think they're gonna pick it up as they go along throughout the semester

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,785
and then realize,

233
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:10,510
oh, I have to know C++ learn C++ and learn [] the same time,

234
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,875
it, it does not end well,

235
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,510
trust me, we've done this up that,

236
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,840
we realize that this really, really help you

237
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,730
rather than make your life,

238
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,950
so if you do not complete this, this project zero by the deadline of september tenth,

239
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
we're going to ask you to drop,

240
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,310
and, and zero exceptions we made,

241
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,560
I don't care that your brother took 513 ten years ago,

242
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,300
and you and you saw what he did back then,

243
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,280
like, it doesn't matter,

244
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,135
you have to complete this,

245
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,350
it shouldn't take that much time, right,

246
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,690
it's a pretty basic trial.

247
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,610
For office hours,

248
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,100
the myself Jignesh and the TAs will hold office hours at various times throughout the week,

249
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
but between Monday and Friday

250
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,320
and then there won't be any office hours regularly on Saturdays,

251
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,110
but the day before the every project is due,

252
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,000
we'll have that sort of power session,

253
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,310
we have multiple for multiple hours available for you, ask questions for,

254
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,530
but this means that there won't be any office hours on the Sunday,

255
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,595
when projects are due,

256
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:14,745
because we don't want people wait to the last minute to try,

257
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,170
you know, to try to work on something

258
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,640
and then, you know, hoping that TAs will help them figure things out right,

259
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,945
Again, this is a forcing function to make sure that, you are making progress, you know, soon,

260
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,660
you start working projects as soon as they released,

261
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,630
you're not trying to do as much as you can at the last, last day,

262
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,790
system programming is not easy,

263
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,900
and you will make mistakes and you have time to figure out.

264
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,580
For this semester, we're actually offering the course to, to CMU-Q students,

265
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,380
so welcome, thank you joining us,

266
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,540
and I realize there's timezone difference

267
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,060
and so we will have A A regularly scheduled office hour,

268
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,090
that lines up with your you your working hours,

269
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,580
with a different TA each week,

270
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,240
I'll announce this Piazza,

271
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,350
when will be, that we these to,

272
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,300
talk to somebody if you need to

273
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,340
and then if you need to talk to myself,

274
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,620
it will post how to schedule calls us at different times as needed,

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,820
again, so this this morning session, or it will be, will be for the CMU-Q students,

276
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,140
we ask the regular, the Pittsburgh CMU students not to use that,

277
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,565
and by all means, please always questions post on Piazza,

278
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:22,810
we'll answer it sooner.

279
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,255
I guess, delay policy for homework,

280
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:34,890
to lose 10% every 24 hour is late

281
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:41,140
and then before they I'm talking about will be only be applicable to for projects,

282
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,380
if there's a medical emergency,

283
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,000
if there's some kind of the term medical emergency,

284
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,180
if you need an extension email as soon as possible

285
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:04,020
and that way we make sure we make the appropriate necessary you to go medical thing the,

286
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,690
but emails sooner rather than later,

287
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,655
it's not ten years, ten weaks,

288
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:19,220
and you come here to help. Let us know,

289
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,350
All right, I got say every year, do not plagiarize,

290
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,530
so all the homework, all the projects must be your own original work,

291
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,905
are not group assignments,

292
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,880
you can discuss your projects with students, that's fine,

293
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,370
you can mean flesh out ideas on the whiteboard,

294
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
but do not copy source code from other people,

295
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,690
do not copy source code from Github,

296
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,090
so again, because we make this public to people outside CMU,

297
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,140
there's a lot of implementations from previous semesters from that are available on Github,

298
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,650
Chatgpt might be able to even do earlier projects,

299
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,530
do not copy them,

300
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,390
because we the we use Gradescope now

301
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,960
and Gradescope has a [] checker

302
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,960
and basically what we do is,

303
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,380
we find all the Github implementations from non-CMU students,

304
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,890
load them up into Github, into Gradescope but fake students

305
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,750
and then see whether you match against them,

306
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,105
do not, do not copy your source code from other students,

307
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,610
do not copy source code from Github,

308
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,770
the Github source code is usually pretty crappy,

309
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,590
we've done experience before she has done this,

310
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,390
the CMU students crush the non-CMU students,

311
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,630
so it's actually in your best interest not to copy now.

312
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,445
Again, there won't be any exceptions, oh, I didn't know,

313
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,750
yeah, the fact that this is recorded lecture,

314
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,875
if we have to report you to Warner hall,

315
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,350
we point to this timestamp in in the lecture and say

316
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,630
where I'm warning you enough to plagiarize

317
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,690
and then you plagiarize. Yeah, and if not, you're screwed, right,

318
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,975
if there's something you want to do that seems kind of like grey zone

319
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,240
and you don't know if it's okay,

320
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,460
like using Chatgpt or something like that, right,

321
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,390
please, you know, email myself and Jignesh not the TAs

322
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,880
to see whether you know, and see whether we want to discuss it,

323
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,750
and then the link there would be CMU's policy or academic integrity,

324
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,870
again, we take this very seriously, don't around.

325
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,430
All right, one of the last thing is that,

326
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,435
if you love as much as I do

327
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,940
and you go beyond the course material,

328
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,380
we are offering a seminar series this semester,

329
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,020
it's entirely optional,

330
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,360
where every Monday starting in September,

331
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,320
we having a different outside speaker come

332
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,340
give a talk about the various database company or project,

333
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,150
so this semester of the theme is machine learning for databases and databaseases machine learning,

334
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,995
and so we have people that are building a lot of these hot thing now,

335
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:33,835
these vector databases,

336
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,130
but discuss next class,

337
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,335
but we're having them talked about their systems,

338
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:41,250
how to support ML like stuff inside of data systems,

339
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,260
and then we'll have people talk about how they're using machine learning to optimize data systems,

340
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,260
sort of like using to make the system actually faster,

341
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,820
so again this is optional,

342
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,880
everything will be on Zoom on Monday at four thirty

343
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,360
and then they will post it on Youtube afterwardswards,

344
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,945
again, in this one, you don't have to be a senior,

345
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,490
neither you can join it, if you you can see the list of the full schedule.

346
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,470
Alright, so that's it for the legislative class,

347
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,960
I gotta figure out what about,

348
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
he's not getting now, anytime soon,

349
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,470
that's about, but it's okay.

350
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,295
So next class on Monday,

351
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,260
we'll have the in class lecture

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,925
and then we'll begin right out of the gate,

353
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,500
not talking any logistics, but the course,

354
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,850
we'll just immediately talk about the relational model and databases.

355
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,010
All right, guys, see you next week.
